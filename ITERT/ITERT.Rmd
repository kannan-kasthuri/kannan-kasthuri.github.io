### <span style="color: blue;"> Learning Objectives </span> {-}

Towards the end of this course the student will exhibit in-depth understanding of data science and analysis methods as well as proficiency in R. The student will produce a portfolio of data analysis projects from the course that demonstrates mastery of analysis and visualization methods. He /She will be equipped for analysis of biomedical and genomic data sets. Another main objective of the course is to communicate statistical results correctly and effectively.

### <span style="color: blue;"> Course Overview </span> {-}

This course is designed to empower students to learn R programming language to conduct data science. We will study a wide range of topics, including, handing and querying databases, exploratory/confirmatory analysis and visualization in R. We will closely follow the book R for Data Science, however the emphasis will be given to working with biomedical data than datasets illustrated and used in the textbook.

This course **does not** have any pre-requisites.
