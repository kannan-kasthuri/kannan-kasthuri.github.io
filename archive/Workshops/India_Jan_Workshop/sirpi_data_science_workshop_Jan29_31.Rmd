#### SIRPI's Successful 3-day Workshop

---

Conducted a successful workshop at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore between Jan. 29-31 (details can be found below). Thanks to Anand Lakshmanan and SIRPI's dedicated folks who made it all possible. It was a terrific experience to see enthusiastic students who were tuned to lectures all the three days. Was such a treat to teach the kids data science.

#### Workshop Details

---

A 3-day intensive and immersive data science workshop. You will get trained in the fundamentals well as in advanced topics of data science using the R programming language. The workshop is designed to demystify data science and to empower participants to perform data analytics. No prior programming experience is necessary. At the end of this workshop you will know data importing, data representation, data wrangling, data visualization, data modeling, and will have ideas on taking your analytics skills to next levels, i.e., machine learning.

Dr. Kasthuri Kannan, PhD, is an Assistant Professor at New York University (NYU). He has more than 10 years of experience in data science and analytics. He started his data science career in 2006 in a company where he contributed to data mining projects and obtained directed insights in aircraft movement operations at the Tinker Air Force base. He proposed efficient strategies for aircraft logistics through analysis of aircraft movement data using machine learning algorithms. He is trained in mathematics and computer science with postdoctoral training at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (one of the top cancer research institutes in the world), where his data science skills were extensively applied to genomics resulting in top-notch publications. He is actively advising and collaborating with several scientists and physician-scientists, translating data science findings to clinical care, and is passionate about teaching and science communication. Currently, he is directing and teaching a course in data science and biomedical informatics at NYU, a required course for a masters degree.
