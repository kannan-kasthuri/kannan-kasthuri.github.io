#### About the workshop

Biomedical Data Science workshop @ NYU Langone Health is a five-day (intensive) data science program, where a team of professionals learns fundamentals of data science. The workshop is designed to demystify data science and to empower people perform data analytics using the R programming language. We will study and practice a wide range of topics, including R fundamentals, visualization, data manipulation and modeling. 

#### Expectations

The workshop **does not** have any pre-requisites, although a little programming experince will be a huge plus. There will be both hands-on sessions and lectures, and the trainees are encouraged (but not required) to bring their own data sets. Towards the end of this workshop the student will exhibit in-depth understanding of data science and analysis methods as well as proficiency in R. He/she will be encouraged to produce a portfolio that demonstrates mastery of analysis and visualization methods. 

#### Agenda

Each day the session will begin at 9 am and end at 4.30 pm with on-your-own lunch break between 12 noon and 1.30 pm. Lectures will be held between 9-10 am and 1.30-2.30 pm followed by hands-on sessions. The lecture agenda are as follows:

Day 1: R fundamentals

Day 2: R Markdown, Visualize and explore

Day 3: Transform, Exploratory data analysis

Day 4: Wrangle data 

Day 5: Basic and advanced data modeling

#### Where to apply and fees

Fill out an application [here]() by _TBD_ at 11:59 pm. Due to volume restrictions, late applications will not be considered. Applicants will be notified at the end of _TBD_ with instructions to pay the fees. If you miss the deadline, you can sign up for the [general workshop form]() to be notified of future opportunities.

Dr. Kasthuri Kannan, PhD, is an Assistant Professor of Pathology at New York University (NYU). He has more than 10 years of experience in data science and analytics. He started his data science career in 2006 in a company where he contributed to data mining projects and obtained directed insights in aircraft movement operations at the Tinker Air Force base. He proposed efficient strategies for aircraft logistics through analysis of aircraft movement data using machine learning algorithms. He is trained in mathematics and computer science with postdoctoral training at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where his data science skills were extensively applied to genomics. He is actively advising and collaborating with several scientists and physician-scientists, translating data science findings to clinical care, and is passionate about teaching and science communication. Currently, he is directing and teaching a course in data science and biomedical informatics at NYU, a required course for masters students in biomedical informatics.
