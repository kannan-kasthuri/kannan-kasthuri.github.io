Service:  CCU

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient remained in-house and was noted to
have peak in her creatinine up to 2.3 over the weekend.
Patient had urine studies sent.  The urine FENa was
calculated at 0.3% consistent with dehydration.  Urinalysis
was otherwise normal and a renal ultrasound was otherwise
normal.  No hydronephrosis or obstruction.  Patient received
two 250 cc boluses of normal saline and had her Foley
replaced for better in and out monitoring, and patient's
creatinine improved the following day to 1.4.

Otherwise, the patient is doing well.  Plans to continue to
follow her renal function likely secondary to overdiuresis
and dehydration with some diarrhea.  Patient is also noted to
have increasing amounts of diarrhea over the weekend.
Clostridium difficile were sent, which are pending to this
date, and otherwise seems stable and changes were consistent
with patient being dehydrated.

Chronic cough/anterior mediastinal mass:  Patient had a CT of
her chest done to better evaluate as she had one episode of
hemoptysis, and with her chronic cough since [**Month (only) 768**].
Patient's CT of the chest showed diffuse hazy ground-glass
opacity effecting the right lung to a greater extent in the
left consistent with pulmonary edema or atypical infectious
process or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Also evidence of prior
granulomatous disease and a lobulated mass in the anterior
mediastinum, which likely represents a thymoma and a small
hiatal hernia.

Patient was re-evaluated by the Hematology/Oncology service.
They felt they needed tissue samples to further diagnose, but
that this was less consistent with a lymphoma picture.
Patient was seen by the CT Surgery service for possible
biopsy or excision.  They are currently reviewing the films
to decide whether a simple biopsy or excision is needed if
this is an infiltrative process.  Patient will continue to
have this worked up as an outpatient as patient will require
being on aspirin and Plavix after her recent stent.  At least
for two weeks, she will have to stay on it preferably for
four months.  This anticoagulation issue can be further
evaluated after review of films and evaluation by CT Surgery.

Anemia:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable over the
weekend, and she will continue to have outpatient followup
with gastroenterologist and anemia, and continue her iron
repletion.

Decreased ejection fraction:  Patient with an EF of 30-35%
and posterolateral akinesis.  Patient was originally started
on lisinopril and started back on her Lasix and
spironolactone regimen.  These were held in light of her
acute renal failure and overdiuresis.  These can eventually
be restarted once creatinine are stable at rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Inferior myocardial infarction.
2. Decreased ejection fraction.
3. Fluid overload.
4. Acute renal failure.
5. Anterior mediastinal mass.
6. Anemia.
7. Cough.
8. Diarrhea.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Will be dictated at time of
discharge.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  Patient is to followup with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**7-29**] days.  Patient is to followup with cardiologist chosen
by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-22**] weeks.  Patient is to have a repeat stress
in [**6-27**] weeks to re-evaluate her RCA lesion.  Patient is to
followup with CT Surgery for further evaluation of her
anterior mediastinal mass.  Patient is to followup with her
hematologist for her anemia.  Patient is to followup with an
outpatient gastroenterologist for further workup of her
guaiac-positive stools.

ADDENDUM:  To prior discharge summary dated [**2158-4-22**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Renal function - The patient's creatinine rose prior to
discharge in the setting of active diuresis.  A renal
ultrasound revealed normal kidneys, no obstructive.
Diuretics were held and the creatinine returned to baseline.

2.  Cardiac - The patient remained stable during the
remainder of her hospital course.  Given her elevated
creatinine, the ace inhibitor was held.  Upon improvement in
her creatinine, Valsartan was started.  An ace inhibitor was
not chosen in light of her chronic cough.  She will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist, at [**Hospital3 3287**].  Plan
to continue Plavix for a minimum of three months.

3.  Mediastinal mass - Chest CT showed a mediastinal mass
most consistent with thymoma.  CT surgery consulted on the
patient as well as hematology/oncology.  Given the likely
slowing progressing mass and CT findings most consistent with
thymoma without impingement on surrounding structures, no
further workup was pursued at this time.  She will have a
repeat CT scan in one month's time to insure stability of the
mass.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10366**], her primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] arrange
for this.  She will then follow-up in three months time with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 384**] of cardiothoracic surgery, telephone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 10367**].  Her appointment is on [**2158-7-27**], at 2:00 p.m.
Plan is to biopsy the mass at that time as the patient can
safely be taken off Plavix to minimize bleeding risk.

4.  Anemia - The patient's hematocrit remained stable.
Further follow-up and monitoring to continue as an outpatient
under the direction of her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 10366**], telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10368**]. Please see prior
discharge summary for further details.

The patient is to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility
at [**Hospital1 **] on [**2158-4-24**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Plavix 75 mg once daily.
3.  Atorvastatin 80 mg once daily.
4.  Metoprolol XL 25 mg once daily.
5.  Pantoprazole 40 mg once daily.
6.  Valsartan 80 mg once daily.
7.  Dorzolamide 2% drops three times a day.

ADDENDUM:  The infant was born at a birth weight of 2745
grams at 35 and 3/7 weeks gestation. His discharge weight was
2715 grams at 37 and [**1-22**] corrected gestational age. Day of
life 14 was the date of discharge.

1. RESPIRATORY: The infant was transferred from the [**Hospital 10627**] Well Baby Nursery to the NICU due to shallow
   breathing and low oxygen saturations on room air. The
   infant's evaluation included a chest x-ray which revealed
   a complete whiteout of both lung fields in addition to his
   physical findings of shallow breathing and some
   retractions. Diagnosis of RDS was made. He was intubated
   and given surfactant and then weaned to CPAP. He was
   eventually weaned to room air by around day 8 of life. His
   respiratory issue was presumed to be clinical pneumonia,
   although no cultures were positive. Antibiotics were
   continued empirically for 7 days. Clinical, his
   respiratory issues resolved and were normal throughout the
   latter half of his neonatal course. He always had a normal
   cardiovascular exam.

1. HEMATOLOGY: The infant had hyperbilirubinemia with a peak
   bilirubin of around 15.5; treated with phototherapy
   blanket. This resolved.

1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Sepsis evaluation was negative,
   resolved.

1. GI AND NUTRITION: Bloody GI aspirate felt to be secondary
   to maternal blood which the infant swallowed after
   delivery. The infant was treated with ranitidine for 72
   hours. No further problems with feeding or upper GI
   bleeding. This again was felt secondary to swallowed
   maternal blood. The infant had a stable nutritional and GI
   status since then.

1. IMMATURE FEEDING: With the baby's mouth prematurity he
   required some gavage feeds and working with developing all
   p.o. feeds which he had at the time of discharge.


1. OTHER: The infant was circumcised. No problems on the day
   of discharge. Also, the infant's hearing screen revealed
   bilateral referral. The parents are to follow up with
   audiology evaluation after discharge. VNA nursing will be
   involved as well.

1. SUMMARY: A 35.5 week gestation infant who had respiratory
   concerns felt to be possibly secondary to immature lungs
   and/or pneumonia; treated empirically. The remainder of
   the course was one of becoming more mature with feedings,
   which occurred.


NAME OF PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  Private pediatrician is Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **]. The infant will be followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The infant was discharged to home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  In excellent condition.

ADDENDUM:  This discharge note covers the dates of [**8-28**]
through [**9-10**] of [**2115**]. A previous interim summary has
been dictated that covers the period of [**8-21**] through
[**8-27**] of [**2115**].

HOSPITAL COURSE CONTINUED:  This is an infant who was born at
32 and 3/7 weeks gestation. Birth weight of 1880 grams. As of
[**8-28**] through time of discharge her remaining clinical
issues were:

1. RASH: Initially thought to be consistent with [**Female First Name (un) 1441**].
   Superficial rash over her face, and trunk, and legs.
   However, none of her cultures were positive. She did have
   5 days of therapy with fluconazole. This was followed by 7
   days of amphotericin. She also had a perianal rash
   consistent with [**Female First Name (un) 1441**], treated with Nystatin powder.
   Some of the skin lesions appeared to be a superficial
   bacterial infection. Therefore, she was also treated with
   Bactroban from [**8-31**] through the time of discharge. A
   dermatology consultation with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10633**] from
   [**Hospital3 5223**] also thought that the skin rash was
   not consistent with [**Female First Name (un) 1441**]. Also notes that none of the
   cultures were positive for [**Female First Name (un) 1441**]. The etiology of her
   rash was not known. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10633**] requested followup of the
   infant as an outpatient.

1. RESPIRATORY STATUS: The infant had no respiratory distress
   immaturity. She did have some occasional mild apnea, but
   this was not a problem or issue for her, and certainly not
   an issue that continued through her nursery course.
   Therefore, respiratory status was stable and normal at the
   time of transfer to [**Hospital1 328**] on [**9-10**].

1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal course and exam.

1. GI AND NUTRITION: The infant tolerated advancement of her
   feeds. At the time of transfer to [**Hospital 328**] Hospital on
   [**9-10**] the infant was feeding 150 cc/kg/day of Similac
   Special Care with 26 calories per ounce and ProMod. She
   was requiring gavage feedings and learning to do all p.o.
   feedings at the time of transfer.

1. HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: The infant was treated with
   phototherapy, which was discontinued on day 5 with a
   bilirubin of 3.8.

1. HEAD ULTRASOUND: The infant had a left germinal matrix
   hemorrhage and a right cortex cyst. The infant's
   evaluation for systemic candidiasis, in terms of eye exam,
   was also negative. She had some splenic cysts on her
   initial abdominal ultrasound. Followup of this was normal.


DISCHARGE STATUS/DISPOSITION:  At the time of discharge on
[**9-10**] (this is on day 20), the infant is transferred to
[**Hospital 328**] Hospital. Corrected gestational age of 35.1 week.
Her weight was 2180 grams. The infant was transferred to
[**Hospital 328**] Hospital Special Care Nursery for continuation of
her convalescent neonatal course.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  At the time of transfer, the infant
was in good condition.

NAME OF PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  At the time of transfer, the
primary pediatrician was identified as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10634**] in
[**Hospital1 328**].

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). TDI E/e' < 8, suggesting normal PCWP
(<12mmHg). No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal calcifications in
aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Calcified tips
of papillary muscles. No MS. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. Normal
tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Indeterminate PA systolic

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. Suboptimal
image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal image quality - poor apical
views. Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The valve apperas well
seated. The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets are thickened. The transaortic
gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. No masses or

Test: Portable TTE (Focused views)
Doppler: Limited Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: Definity
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT VENTRICLE: Asymmetric LVH. Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%). Severe resting LVOT gradient.

MITRAL VALVE: Trivial MR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
There is asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). With infusion of dobutamine at 5 mcd/kg/min, there is a severe
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (120 mmHg). Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Infusion of
echocontrast into the first and second branches of the second septal
perforator demonstrates focal opacification of the hypertrophied basal septum,
without extension into the moderator band.

IMPRESSION: Severe inducible LVOT obstruction. Favorable anatomy for ethanol
septal ablation.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84 yof with hx of CAD s/p MI, HTN, Hyperlipdemia, PVD, PE
   s/p IVC filter placement, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia, possible
   CHF who was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for respiratory failure. Clinical
   status has continues to decline.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented to [**Hospital1 54**] intubated in
   respiratory failure presumed [**1-1**] CHF and PNA with elevated BNP and CTA
   showing bilateral consolidations with co-existing ARDS. Patient started
   on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation. At this time sputum is
   positive for Pseudomonas, Asparagillus, and CMV. ID is consulting. Pt
   receiving pip/tazo, voriconazole. ID will consider gancyclovir.
   -          cont pip/tazo
   -          Give two doses of vori 300mg IVq12 then reduce to 200mg
   IVq12
   -          cont assist control ventilation per ARDS protocol
   -          monitor oxygen status, if worsens, consider diuresis
   -          Still considering PCP treatment given prolonged steroid use.
   If declines, add
   # Anemia: Hx of Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. On solumendrol 60mg
   IV daily. Most likely due to toxic metabolic state plus MDS. DD
   includes diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          Received 1U pRBC o/n
   -          cont Solumedrol daily
   -          Fe studies and B12 Folate NL.
   -          DIC labs NL
   -          Hemolysis labs NL
   -          H/O following
   -          piparacillin both may be complicating this. Will change
   based on cultures when possible. Considering meropenem.
   -          Vancomycin may have been complicating this. Now D/Ced
   # Thrombocytopenia: persistent this admission. As with anemia, most
   likely due to MDS and toxic metabolic state. HIT seems inconsistent in
   spite of HIT history
   -          Avoid all heparin products
   -          Holding ASA and NSAIDs in general
   -          H/O following.
   -          Vancomycin may have been complicating this. Now D/Ced.
   # Leukopenia: Still low, but recovered somewhat. Etiology is most like
   MDS and toxic metabolic state, as above. [**Month (only) 60**] consider G-CSF
   -          Etiology unclear.
   -          H/O following
   # R upper limb ?thombophlebitis: Red and erythematous at site of old
   PICC
   -          US today
   -          Consider Abx (vanc? Again)
   # CHF:  Patient with history of CHF, unknown type, EF 50%
   -          ECHO NL with mildly reduced EF
   -          Hold, Aldactone, ACEi, BB
   -          Lasix as needed depending on pulmonary status
   # CAD s/p MI:  Hx of MI.
   -          Hold ASA given thrombocytopenia
   -          Hold statin, BB, ACEi
   # DM: on metformin at home.
   -          hold metformin while in ICU
   -          Insulin drip for glucose control
   # Hypotension:  Most likely in setting of intubation and
   Fentanyl/Versed.  Now resolved.
   # PE: ?history of IVC filter placement, no filter on CT scan
   -          Pneumoboots for now, no Heparin given ?HIT
   # HTN: hold home BB, ACEi, Lasix, Aldactone, Diltiazem

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 84F respiratory failure with B infiltrates
   and evolving pancytopenia of unclear etiology. Has been treated in
   recent past with high dose steroids for hemolytic anemia.  Mini BAL
   growing pseudomonas, aspergillus and cmv - ID consulting. S/p PRBC
   overnight. Stopped vanco.
   Exam notable for diffuse anasarca with areas of severe ecchymoses on
   arms and hands. Tm 99.1 BP 90/35 HR 90-117 RR 25 with sat 96% on A/C
   340 x25 PEEP 12 FiO2 0.5. CVP 4-8. Unresponsive on fentanyl and
   midazolam without overbreaths. Nasal bleeding (L>R). rhonhci and
   crackles B bases, RRR s1s2 c [**2-3**] SM at base. Decreased BS but soft
   abdomen. 3+ edema. Labs notable for WBC 2.7K, HCT 31.3, plts 53K, K+
   4.1, Cr 0.5, 7.33/49/71 on Fi02 .5
   Agree with plan to continue ARDS ventilation with Vt 340 x RR 25, PEEP
   12, O2 weaned down to 0.5 overnight. Await ID input on antibiotics
   currently on voriconazole, pip/tazo. Albumin low and likely
   contributing significantly to anasarca and difficultly weaning from
   ventilator. Will begin to wean steroids; . Will give fluids if anuric
   or hypotensive but will otherwise run even. Continue IV insulin gtt for
   glycemic control, goal 100-150. Ongoing concern for MDS presist. Will
   hold on GCSF for now given bump in WBC and will d/c ASA. Remainder of
   plan as outlined above. Continue discussions with family regarding
   overall level of care, given lack of improvement.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 50 min

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with PMHx of CAD & CHF presents with lower extremity edema &
   acute hct drop likely due to lower GI bleed in setting of elevated INR.
   .# GI Bleed: Pt presented with acute hct drop in setting of elevated
   INR, now s/p FFP x 1 and Vitamin K 10mg IV and 2 units PRBCs.  HCT did
   not increase as much as expected ([**3-29**]) but did respond, so this is
   unlikely a brisk GI bleed.  Pt was guaiac positive with brown stool,
   etiology of bleed not entirely clear and pt denies any BRBPR/melena,
   nausea/epigastric pain, no prior history GI bleed.  Possible sources
   are a slow upper GI bleed (ulcer vs esophageal varices? ETOH history),
   diverticular bleed.  Slight possibility that thoracic aneurysm is
   bleeding as it has not yet been imaged, but patient is asymptomatic so
   this is unlikely.  Unlikely head, retroperitoneal bleed.   Hemolysis
   remains a possibility.
    - maintain active type & cross
   - 2 x PIVs
   - GI recs: EGD on Monday
   - PPI IV BID
   -image thoracic aneurysm
   -HCT stable: 28.1>>30.2>>30.6>>30.4
continue to monitor
   -hemolysis labs: haptoglobin normal, LDH slightly elevated at 269. But
   HCT stable today. Not concerned for hemolysis currently.
   .
   # CHF: Pt has a history CHF s/p MI with depressed EF that has since
   improved, last echo from [**12-29**] showed EF of 50%. Pt reports acute on
   chronic lower extremity swelling but lungs clear on exam. BNP elevated
   at 4054.  Possible high output failure [**1-24**] anemia.  LE edema improved
   with diuresis.
    - supplemental oxygen

   Pt reports recent exertional exhaustion but denies chest pain.  This
   could be stable angina, but this is occurring in setting of acute hct
   drop, more likely demand ischemia.  EKG does not show any acute ST-T
   wave changes, will monitor for symptoms
   - holding Aspirin 81mg given GI bleed, c/s GI about restarting post EGD
   - will restart Metoprolol, Captopril this AM given stable HCT
   - holding statin until patient tolerating PO
   - am EKGs

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of severe AS (0.4cm) now presenting with
   obstructive cholangitis, blood Cx positive for GNRs and pulm edema.
   # Ascending Cholangitis: Pt presented to OSH with vague complaints of
   abd pain, elevated Alk Phos, Tbili, transaminases and CT Abd showed
   gallstones, otherwise negative.  RUQ U/s showed sludge and probable
   small stones in GB, no thickening of the wall, ?CBD 11mm. Pt developed
   rising WBC ct and worsening LFTs, blood Cx + GNRs and pt was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for emergent ERCP.  After evaluation by GI, ERCP
   was performed.  Pus and sludge removed. No stones or strictures.
   -Zosyn 2.25mg IV q 8hr
   -clear liquie diet. UOP about 30cc/hour. Encourage po intake. Gentle
   boluses if UO drops.
   -blood cultures from OSH showed pan sensitive E.coli
   -send Blood Cx now
   -advance diet as tolerated
   #Intermittent Bradycardia: Occasionally bradycardic to 30s, especially
   while sleeping. Patient is asymptomatic. EKG looks like second degree
   heart block.
   .
   # Pulm Edema/AS: Pt with oxygen requirement of 4L and bilateral
   crackles at bases, CXR shows mild vascular engorgement.  Edema likely
   secondary to critical AS & IVF given at OSH. Pt with severe AS but
   denies h/o CHF and is not maintained on lasix or BB.  Pt has clearly
   expressed wishes for DNR/DNI status, will need be very careful with
   volume status.  ECHO report from [**Hospital1 1244**] showed severe AS with valve area
   of 0.4cm and LVEF of 60%.  Will hold off on lasix currently given
   marginal BPs and GNR bacteremia.
   - ECHO ordered
   - very gentle boluses of 250cc to maintain MAPs/UOP
   - supplemental O2
   - hold ACE-I for now
   .
   # Bacteremia: OSH reports GNR (pan sensitive E.coli) from Blood Cx
   drawn today likely due to obstructive cholangitis, presumed bowel
   flora.  Plan to continue empiric zosyn, pt currently hemodynamically
   stable
   - continue Zosyn 2.25mg IV q 8hr given recent instrumentation
   .
   # ARF: Pt presented with creatinine of 0.9 that rose to 1.6 at OSH
   before transfer, creatinine has come down slightly in house, currently
   back down to 1.1. This may be due to sepsis, will monitor UOP carefully
   -encourage po intake. Gentle IVF boluses of 250cc prn to maintain
   UO>30cc/hr
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine 150mcg
   .
   # FEN: Clear liquids
   # Access: PIV x 2
   # PPx: Heparin sc TID, PPI
   # Code:  DNR/DNI confirmed with pt & HCP
   # Dispo: ICU
   # Comm: with pt & daughter [**Name (NI) 1876**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4399**] cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4400**]

   cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
   depressed. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic root is

   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension.
   Microbiology: blood and urine cultures pending
   ECG: ECG: NSR with long PR, RBBB, PVCs.  Unchanged from prior.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 78 F with MMP including dHF, OSA, s/p trach, HTN, DM, atrial
   fibrillation on warfarin, history of LGIB [**1-25**] diverticulosis in [**2111**]
   presents with rectal bleeding.
   .
   # BRBPR - likely etiology is diverticulosis given similar presentation
   in [**2111**] where colonoscopy showed diverticulosis. Other possibilities
   include mesenteric ischemia, malignancy, hemorrhoids.  No evidence of
   UGI source given overall stability and negative NGL.  Patient was
   transiently hypotensive but responded well to IVF. GI is aware of
   patient and no emergent plans for procedure overnight.  Surgery and IR
   also aware; potential for intervention tonight.
   - to angio now.
   - active type and screen
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - consider CTA abd/pel to evaluate for mesenteric ischemia, though
   diverticulosis more likely source at current time.
   - hold warfarin.
   - reverse with FFP, vitamin K, profilnine.
   - transfuse PRBC liberally despite diastolic heart failure given fast
   rate of losses with plans to transition to ventilator if needed for
   respiratory support.
   - Q4H HCT
   - GI, surgery, IR following.
   .
   # Chronic dHF- last TTE shows grade I diastolic dysfxn and EF 50-55%
   - hold lasix, lisinopril given concern for hypotension.
   - can rest on vent if needed.
   - lasix prn to even out fluid balance once losses stabilize.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Multifactorial respiratory failure
   with OSA, CHF, also ?reactive component on multiple nebs.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   - Volume status as above.
   - Repeat film in AM and likely again following diuresis to eval for
   possible infiltrate, as was having increasing O2 requirements at rehab
   prior to transfer.
   - Sputum culture; cover vanc and zosyn for now given HD instability,
   questionable appearance of CXR and report of increased sputum, and
   bandemia.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation.
   - hold warfarin and reverse INR.
   - hold diltiazem
   .
   # NSTEMI.  Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK.  Likely demand in
   setting of large GI losses.
   - Serial enzymes.
   - Can d/w cards in AM.
   - Adequate transfusion resuscitation.
   - Hold on ASA, plavix, heparin given magnitude of bleed.
   .
   # UTI.  Continuous hospital exposures with risk for resistent
   organisms.
   - Zosyn for now and followup cultures.
   .
   # Diabetes- seems like this is diet controlled, no diabetes medications
   on past d/c summaries, [**11-30**] HgbA1c 6.1%
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # CKD- stage III, baseline 1.5.
   - holding lisinopril and antihypertensives overnight.
   - avoid overdiuresis in next few days given angio and contrast exposure
   overnight.
   .
   # Access- 2 18 g PIV.  PICC (?PICC - not seen on film) not flushing
   currently, will try TPA, low threshold to place TLC or Cordis.

   Chief Complaint:  sepsis, abdominal pain
   HPI:
   62 yo female with extensive past medical and surgical history who was
   just discharged from the surgical service on [**7-26**] after undergoing on
   [**2151-7-18**] exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of
   adhesions, abdominal colectomy, end ileostomy, Hartmann's pouch
   creation, transgastric jejunostomy feeding tube placement.  She is
   transferred from [**Hospital1 54**] [**Location (un) 1415**] where she was admitted for hyponatremia.
   She also had bilateral flank pain on admit concerning for UTI/pyelo.
   While there, she developed fever, then hypotension today and
   transferred to the MICU.  In the MICU, she was given broad spectrum
   antibiotics, stress dose steroids, as well as started on levophed for
   presumed sepsis.  She had blood cultures there which are no growth to
   date, and urine cultures which showed serratia and e.coli.  She had CVL
   attempt, first subclavian which was unsuccessful, then had a left
   femoral CVL and a-line placed in sterile condition prior to transfer.
   She was transferred to the MICU here for further evaluation and
   management of her sepsis as well as surgical evaluation for potential
   abdominal source of infection.
   In the MICU, the patient is tired, but able to answer questions.  She
   is unable to provide much history, most of which is obtained from her
   husband and the medical record.  Currently, she reports having
   abdominal pain which started in the last day.  She denies abdominal
   pain prior to that.  She denies nausea or vomiting.  She does report
   having fevers and chills in the last day.  She is not quite sure about
   her ostomy output.  She did have some mild dysuria.  She denies chest
   pains, shortenss of breath.
   Review of systems:
   (+) Per HPI
   (-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache,
   sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of
   breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea,

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 62 yo female with adrenal insufficiency,
   hypothyroidism, neurogenic bladder, s/p multiple surgeries most recent
   on [**7-18**] with necrotic colon s/p colectomy with ileostomy, hartmann's
   pouch, and GJ tube placement who was admitted to [**Hospital1 2567**] with
   hyponatremia, and during that hospitalization started having fevers,
   abdominal pain, and hypotension
   # Sepsis: patient has significant leukocytosis (>30K), hypotensive
   despite fluids now on norepinephrine, fevers, abdominal pain, and urine
   culture that is positive.  The abdominal pain is new, and given her
   extensive surgical history fairly recently, there is concern for
   abdominal pathology present.  UA not markedly abnormal, but urine
   culture from [**8-5**] with serratia and e.coli.  CXR without any focal
   abnormality but appears to show volume overload likely in the setting
   of IVFs
   - will check LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - check coags
   - cont levophed for MAP>60
   - IVFs boluses PRN
   - check blood, urine, sputum culture
   - repeat CXR
   - check CT abdomen for abdominal source of infection
   - check lactate
   - stress dose steroids for known adrenal insufficiency,
   methylprednisolone 100 mg IV q8
   - start ceftazidime, vancomycin, and flagyl to cover broad spectrum
   both urine and GI source
   - surgical consult for eval of abdomen
   - NPO for now
   - morphine PRN
   # Adrenal insufficiency: on chronic steroids at home

   Critical Care:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname **] has progressively declined with vigorous IV fluid
   rescucitation overnight with impending respiratory muscle fatigue and
   acidosis. The Abdominal CT scan shows dilated loops pf small bowel and
   features of a pelvic collection ( Debris vs Blood vs abscess). She is
   being treated for both UTI and small bowel ischemia. Surgical staff
   have assessed and feel she is too risky for the OR at present given her
   hemodynamics.
   WBC is 49 K, lactate is 3.8, creat of 1.4 and Hct of 27.2 and Na of
   128.
   We will continue supportive care with IVF/ NaHCO3 as needed/ventilator
   management and repeat abd CT with IV contrast if IR is to place drain
   in the pelvic collection. Broad antibiotics will continue and steroids
   ( for adrenal crisis) have been added for now too although with
   abdominal sepsis, we may need to taper to lowest levels. She is gravely
   ill and I have spoken with her husband regarding this. She will remain
   a full code.

   Critical Care:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   His Chest CT shows extensive pleural fluid in left chest with concerns
   of rounded atelectasis at base. Right lung is now clear and there are
   no new worrisome nodules noted either.
   He is more awake with decreasing sedation and capable of understanding
   commands. Secretion output has increased but his gag/ cough are strong.
   He is off lasix but remains 2.7 L negative.
   He will have an attempt at extubation today. We will use atrovent over
   albuterol for wheeze ( given tachycardia) and will request thoracic
   surgery staff to advise regarding any definitive options for his left
   effusion especially if there are concerns regarding trapped lung.
   Patient is critically ill

   EVALUATION:
   An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed today
   in collaboration with Radiology.  Thin liquid, Nectar-thick liquid,
   pureed consistency barium, one cookie coated with barium and one barium
   pill were administered. Results follow:
   ORAL PHASE:
   The oral phase was remarkable for moderately reduced bolus control with
   premature spillover of thin and nectar thick liquid to the valleculae
   and pyriform sinuses prior to the swallow.  Despite nearly edentulous
   status, pt able to chew and clear cookie within less than 30 seconds.
   Notable for moderate oral cavity residue after the first swallow,
   required [**12-21**] swallows to clear each bite/sip from the oral cavity.
   PHARYNGEAL PHASE:
   Notable for a large glob of secretions which were sitting in the
   pharynx (coating pharyngeal wall) prior to PO intake.  Pt tried to
   cough and clear this glob multiple times without success.  Yankauer
   suctioning also not successful and resulted in significant agitation.
   Physiologically, the pharyngeal phase of the swallow was remarkable for
   mildly reduced epiglottic deflection and mildly reduced bolus
   propulsion with mild-moderate residue in the vallecuale and pyriform
   sinuses following the initial swallow.  This cleared with repeat
   swallows.  Otherwise WNL for swallow initiation, palatal elevation and
   laryngeal valve closure.
   ASPIRATION/PENETRATION:
   During the course of the evaluation, the mucous in pharyngeal cavity
   became loosened and coated with barium material.  This subsequently
   dripped into the laryngeal vestibule and pt coughed, attempting to
   clear.  There were no other episodes of laryngeal penetration or
   aspiration of actual PO boluses.
   SUMMARY:
   Pt presents with mild oropharyngeal dysphagia complicated by a coating
   of secretions on the pharyngeal wall which loosened during the
   evaluation and dripped into the airway.  Pt was unable to spontaneously
   clear this and was unable to tolerate suctioning [**12-20**] agitation.  Other
   than this secretion issue, pt had no laryngeal penetration or
   aspiration on today's evaluation.  He appears safe for his baseline
   diet of regular solids and thin liquids with aspiration precautions.
   He will benefit from distant supervision with PO to maintain
   precautions, but likely will not tolerate direct assistance with
   intake.  Please reconsult if there are further concerns for aspiration
   of food/liquid or other dysphagia and a repeat evaluation can be
   performed.
   This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome Severity
   Scale (DOSS) rating of 5, mild dysphagia.
   RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. PO diet: regular solids, thin liquids
   2. PO meds whole with thin liquids
   3. TID oral care
   4. Distant supervision with meals to maintain aspiration precautions
   and assist with self-feed as willing.
   5. Please page/reconsult if we can be of further assistance.
   These recommendations were shared with the patient, the nurse and the
   medical team.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with obesity hypoventilation, ? COPD, afib, ESRD on HD, PVD
   with recent TMA ulcer, presents with confusion in the setting of
   hypoglycemia and hypotension.
   # Somnolence: continues to be somnolent on exam today. Ddx includes
   narcotics, electrolytes (no abnl today), hypoglycemia (but still
   somonolent with improved FS), adrenal insufficiency
   - try Narcan x 1 today
   - add on ammonia
   - noncontrast head CT
   - continue D10
   - hydrocort 50 IV x 1 for ? adrenal insufficiency this afternoon
   # Hypotension: unlikely true hypotension given normal dopplered
   pressures
   - trend lactates for hypoperfusion if hypotensive via dopplers
   # Hypoglycemia: pt not taking in po
s which is major contribution to
   his hypoglycemia.  Wife does not want NG/OG.
   - continue D10
   - continue frequent FS
   - talk to wife regarding nutrition options (NGT, PEG)
   # ESRD: s/p Friday HD session, no signs of uremia or volume level
   - VBG
   - CXR
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Atrial fibrilallation:
   - check digoxin level
   - continue home digoxin and metoprolol
   # PVD:
   - appreciated Vsurg recs
   # LUE edema: u/s negative on left side, right UE DVT seen, right upper
   extremity ultrasound pending. Likely HD cath related.
   - talk to renal for ? resiting of HD line

   TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
   The right ventricular cavity is dilated with focal hypokinesis of the
   apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   There is a large globular mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet.
   There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate
   thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is mild functional mitral
   stenosis due to mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
   structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-10-20**], the left atrial myxoma is no longer present. There is
   now a mass on the posterior mitral leaflet consistent with
   endocarditis.
   ABD U/S:
   1. Gallbladder sludge with wall thickening, which may be secondary to
   the
   patient's low albumin. No cholelithiasis. No specific sign of
   cholecystitis.
   2. Urothelial thickening involving the renal pelves bilaterally, right
   greater than left, and given the bilateral findings, this may represent
   chronic urinary tract infections, particularly fungal. Clinical
   correlation
   is recommended. Also increased echogenicity of the kidneys bilaterally,
   likely reflecting chronic medical renal disease.
   3. Subtle diffuse hepatic nodularity, suggesting the possibility of
   chronic
   liver disease.
   4. Bilateral pleural effusions and minimal ascites.
   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, PNA, pulmonary edema 2/2 systolic CHF requiring
   intermittent diuresis and s/p drainage 800cc reportedly transudative
   fluid via R thoracentesis at OSH, and pulmonary hemorrhage felt [**12-31**]
   anticoagulation and ?trauma with lingular abrasion; continuing to
   suction bloody secretions. Sputum cx growing only yeast to date.
   - Patient was treated with full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - F/u OSH cx (blood, sputum, thoracentesis)
   - Cycle Hct to ensure stable
   - Holding coumadin (also no longer e/o AV thrombus)
   - Gentle diuresis to run pt even
   - Wean PEEP, trial of pressure support as tolerated. Of note, intubated
   x 13 days, and may need to have trach.
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.
   - Cte PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**])
   - ID consult for treatment course and outpt f/u of endocarditis
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - Will notify Cards on Monday of evaluation for possible valvuloplasty
   - Not candidate for AV replacement given clinical status and
   endocarditis
   - Gentle lasix with gtt for goal even
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   # Anemia:  Has bloody secretions from ET tube and guaiac positive
   stools.
   - Cycle hcts [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   - check hemolysis labs and retic
   .
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up.
   Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by Urology with
   plan to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis
   but did have urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as
   well as chronic renal dysfunction. Ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**]
   diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine
   lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - Given + yeast in UA and radiologic finding suggestive of possible
   fungal UTI change foley, repeat UCx today if persists will rx.
   # Transaminitis: H/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.  LFTs
   normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51,
   amylase 238.  Abdominal U/S and CT abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence
   of RUQ process, though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
   Abd u/s here suggests chronic liver disease. Pt currently w/o RUQ pain.
   Ddx includes congestive hepatopathy and autoimmune process.
   - F/u LFTs today and trend
   - Gentle diuresis as above
   - Holding statin
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably decreased. Likely [**12-31**] underlying liver
   disease, now with reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia.  Ddx
   also includes HITT. No schistocytes on smear to suggest [**Doctor First Name 2674**], and DIC
   unlikely with INR normalizing off coumadin and fibrinogen >100.
   - F/u HIT Ab
   - Consider hemolysis from endocarditis->will check labs today
   # H/o aortic valvular thrombus: Chronically anticoagulated but held in
   the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrhage (though only received
   1U PRBC for this at OSH). No thrombus seen on TTE at OSH or here.
   - Systemic anticoagulation discontinued; can consider d/w Cards utility
   of continuing anti-coagulation when stable
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - F/u wound care recs
   .
   # HTN: Worsens in setting of anxiety. Holding lisinopril given ARF;
   avoid nitro or neg inotropes given AS. Labetolol was effective for her
   last pm. Would use this again if necessary.

   grade CoNS and VRE BSI s/p removal of leads who initially presented on
   [**8-17**] with hypotension and UTI.  He was admitted to the MICU and
   recieved aggressive fluid resuscitation and developed rapid pulmonary
   edema requiring intubation.  Pt was diuresed with lasix, diuril and
   acetozolomide with good effect and pt was successfully extubated. Over
   this time pt continued to spike low grade temps, however, blood
   cultures were consistently negative. He was treated with a 14 day
   course of Meropenem. Pt was called out to the floor on HD 9. On HD 10,
   pt had an episode of dizzyness and lethargy (no chest pain) with BP of
   64/palp and HR 50s in the setting of being 1L neg. Pt was bolused 1L NS
   and BPs improved to the 80s before he was transferred to the MICU.  He
   improved with 2.5L IVF and transferred back to the floor [**8-29**]. He was
   then noted to be hypotensive again with BP 64/palp with dizziness and
   lethargy while on the bedpan, and trasmitted back to the MICU. He was
   given more IVF and then noted to have pulm edema, for which he was
   re-intubated. He was started on dopamine gtt and IV lasix. He was again
   successfully re-extubated, after which he had an episode of bradycardia
   and hypotension that resolved with increased dopamine. He was
   successfully weaned off pressors and was transferred to [**Hospital1 2259**] for
   continued care. While on [**Hospital1 2259**] (for around 24hr) pt developed
   hypertension and SOB, found to be tachypneic and tachycardic c
   ventilatory failure on ABG and was intubated. He was hemodynamically
   stable throughout this time.

   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   Recurrent acute congestive heart failure in setting of severe left
   ventricular dysfunction.
   Will review prior cath films for consideration of cardiac
   catheterization
   Not a candidate for a biventricular icd given recurrent infections in
   the past.
   would favor right heart cath today and aggressive diuresis

   Assessment and Plan
   Metabolic Alkalosis: likely [**3-11**] diuresis, (chloride loss), replete
   chloride with KCl.
   ##  Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient looks very
   comfortable, no-longer tachypneic,  sat
ing extremely well.
   -Would diurese back to even for LOS
   .
   ##. ? Seizures: Unclear if patient was ever seizing, neurology raised
   the point that his recent bleed is a nidus, and would be a good
   indication for prophylactic antiseizure meds.
   .
   ##   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Improved, may represent volume contraction from
   lasix or improved renal function with bactrim stopped.
   -follow
   .
   ##. ? Sinusitis: drainage resolved,   would stop antibiotics at this
   point.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - ppx meds
   .
   ##. Tachycardia: Patient looks calm, did not admit to pain, may
   represent intravascular volume depletion.
   .
   ##. FEN: unable to pass OG tube [**3-11**] intolerance, Will ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to
   discuss IR guided OG tube with family.

   Assessment and Plan
   // Sepsis
    - [**3-27**] BCx + MSSA
    - repeat bcx pending. If cont +, will need echo to r/o valvular
   seeding
    - change abx Vanc -> Naf for
    - indwelling femoral dialysis line pulled
    - spiked again, wbc trending down
    - Will continue HD support, - responding well to IVF boluses
    - Cont vanc for now pending ID/Sensi
 if MSSA change to Naf
    - surveillance bcx after line removal.
   // Hypotension
    - stable today
    - able to manage with IVF boluses
   // Fever
     - down today
   // ESRD:
    - renal service following
    - needs temp dialysis line
    - suspect will need dialysis today or tomorrow since received sig
   boluses for fluid resuscitation, fluid with iv abx
   // Seizure disorder:
    - no evidence of current activity
    - cont keppra/oxcarbazemine

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o M with hx EtOH cirrhosis, portal hypertension and
   gastroesophageal varices who is s/p failed TIPs procedure who was
   admitted to MICU intubated, sedated with hypotension.
   .
   # hypotension: Patient with h/o hypertension. SBPs down to 70s
   intra-procedure. Pt  was maintained on low dose neo with sbps in 100s
   while intubated and sedated with propofol. Successfully weaned off Neo
   at 1 am.  Patient with risk of bleeding given coagulopathy and failed
   procedures.
   - serial hcts - stable
   - maintaining SBPs 100s-120s off of neo
   - holding antihypertensives, diuretics
   - Has new leukocytosis: .  Afebrile and lactate 1.0. Consider pan
   culture (blood, urine, para) if becomes hypotensive or lactate rises.
   Must consider infection from transcutaneous and GI sources
   .
   # h/o respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection;  pt
   self-extubated shortly thereafter, and now has been transitioned to 2L
   NC.
   .
   # Failed TIPs procedure (and thrombectomy):
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - f/u CT abd/pelvis final read
   - On Ceftriaxone prophylactically for infection s/p recent procedures.
   A short course of [**11-26**] days may be sufficient.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop from 30 to 25 post-procedure and then to 23
   overnight. Patient is now s/p 2units after failed TIPS procedure.
   - Q4 hcts have been stable
   - Would use serial abd exam and intra-abdominal pressure monitoring
   (using bladder pressure as a surrogate marker) to monitor  for any
   occult bleed
   .
   # Ascites:  Tapped x 2, but not sent for cell counts or culture.
   Patient is already on ceftriaxone.
   - Would not tap again since the ascites may actually be tamponading
   further bleeding in the liver.
   .
   # Borderline DM2
   - qid FS
   .
   # Hypertension
   - holding home meds
   .
   # Asthma
   - holding home Advair, consider nebs
   .
   # Anxiety, panic attacks
   - holding home lithium, lexapro
   .
   # FEN: Was NPO, transition to clear liquids then advance as tolerated.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60M with HTN, emphysema/restrictive lung disease who presents
   with lightheadedness and hct drop, consistent with GIB.
   .
   #  GIB:  Pt dropped hct from baseline 44-48 to 26.  Pt with \"diarrhea\"
   and melena on exam.  Likely UGIB by history. Concerning for gastritis,
   PUD and gastric cancer given ethnicity, smoking, etoh intake.
   - GI following, EGD scheduled for this AM.
   - PPI gtt
   - 2 PIVs
   - Keep an active type and screen
   - Check serial Hct [**Hospital1 7**]; Current Hct of 26 acceptable as long as it
   remains stable.
   - repeat h.pylori (hasn
t had one since his most recently trip to
   [**Country **])
   - hold aspirin
   .
   #  R-sided pleuritic chest pain: low suspicion for ACS; EKG was WNL on
   admission.
   - Repeat EKG, if suspicious for ACS, check cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #  Pulmonary fibrosis: pt does not have a good insight into his lung
   disease at this time. Will need outpatient follow up to slow
   progression of the disease
   - smoking cessation counseling
   - Needs an appt at the ILD center for outpatient follow up.
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Likely secondary to GIB, but given low grade fever,
   pt was pan-cultured.
   - f/u final read of CXR
   - f/u Blood Cx, UCx
 so far NGTD
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Holding atenolol.
   .
   #  FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO

   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI drip
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Code: confirmed full

   diffuse subpleural fibrosis.
   Agree with plan to mange UGIB with EGD, PPI IV, and serial HCT with
   blood product support in the setting of blood loss anemia. Likely GU
   worsened by NSAIDS but EtOH hx makes variceal disease possible. Will
   check H. pylori serology. Given mild CP on history and exam, will check
   EKG and troponin now. He appears to have significant fibrosis with
   early restriction based on prior [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need appointment at ILD

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, questionable H1N1
   influenza from the OSH complicated by ARDS and respiratory failure that
   is currently clinically improving.
   1. Respiratory Failure
 likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1
   and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue weaning ventillator settings as tolerated
 last gas was
   7.40/45/93
 decrease PEEP to 8 and check an abg 1-2 hours after the
   change.
   -- Acid Base status
 metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   from diuresis.  Continue to use acetazolamide to diurese  and decrease
   bicarb for one more day
   -- ct wean sedation as tolerated
 currently on  Midazolam 8
   -- Trial of pressure support [**5-22**] this afternoon if PEEP of 8 is
   tolerated and oxygenation is maintained
   2. Pneumonia / leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1 at OSH.
   Protracted clinical course may be [**2-19**] to bacterial superinfection or
   even VAP, with a component of drug fever. CT negative for effusion or
   fluid collection in the abdomen
 Currently afebrile, leukocytosis is
   trending down
   -- ID signed off
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
 currently afebrile for multiple days
   continue to monitor closely
   3. Acute renal failure
 Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy. Improving,
   Creatinine at now 0.8
 contraction alkalosis improving, partially
   autodiuresing
   -- trend Cr
   -- Stop acetazolamide, allow her to auto diurese
   -- Fluid balance goal of negative 1 L today. Use a bolus of Lasix if
   necessary.
   4. Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology, likely related to infection vs.
   meds. ALT, AST and AP elevations in cholestatic pattern raises concern
   for acalculous cholecystitis; however, pt is s/p CCY.  Repeat
   ultrasound negative.  Transaminases improving in the setting of DC
   antibiotics.
   -- D/C Ursadiol for one more day
   -- Continue to trend
   -- Hep A IgG positive
   -- Hep B S ab negative
 vaccinate during admission
   #. DM
   -- Continue on SSI
   .
   #. HL
   -- Continue to hold lipitor in the setting of increasing LFTs
   .
   # Depression
   -- Continue prozac

   Agree with this excellent MSIV note.  The pt. continues to be making
   progress in terms of ventilator requirements.  Will continue to wean
   sedation.  Will decrease PEEP to 8 and check ABG.  If tolerated, will
   do a trial of PS 5/5 this afternoon.

   Assessment and Plan
   73M with B cell lymphoma recent begun on multidrug chemo, severe CAD
   s/p recent NSTEMI, severe AS, ESRD on HD, who presented with worsening
   hypotension and new fever
   .
   #. Hypotension - DDx includes septic/distributive shock from infectious
   preocess causing his fever. Also possible is cardiogenic shock given
   his recent NSTEMI with know diffuse CAD, severe AS, and pre-existant
   cardiomyopathy, however this is less likely given prompt recovery.
   There is no evidence for hypovolemic shock, his HCT has been normal and
   there are no signs of bleeding.
   -- blood pressures have been stable over the last 24 hours, feel that
   most important thing is to get a reliable BP read
   .
   #. Fever - multiple etiologies are possible in this patient who is
   trending towards neutropenia, including dialysis line infection,
   port-a-cath infection, gut translocation, UTI, and repsiratory
   infection.
   -- have dc
ed tamiflu, ruled out for flu
   -- FU sputum culture
   -- FU blood cultures from line, HD cath, and periphery
   -- sepsis management with CVP monitoring, pressors, and central venous
   O2 sat monitoring
   .
   # CAD s/p NSTEMI - no evidence for cardiogenic shock at this time. Has
   been deemed an un-intervenable case.
   [**Hospital **] medical management with ASA, plavix, and statin
   -- holding BB and ACE-I given hypotension
   -- unable to heparinize given thrombocytopenia
   -- monitor for arryhtmia on telemetry, heart rhythm was most likely
   Wenckebach
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 30-35%
   -- volume management at HD
   -- holding BB, ACE as above
   -- no spironolactone for now until BP normalizes
   -- hold digoxin, check level
   -- strict I/O, low salt diet
   -- daily weights
   .
   # Rhythm/AF - has h/o AF, but feel that recent rhythm was Wenckbach,
   confirmed with cards
   - monitor on tele
   -- unable to anticoagulate
   .
   # Severe aortic stenosis - will be preload dependent, so excessive
   dialysis could lead to profound hypotension. Excessive afterload
   reduction will cause similar symptoms.
   -- unable to receive BB for now given hypoTN
   -- ensure euvolemia
   -- not a surgical candidate
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient receives MWF HD.
   -- Continue phoslo, nephrocaps
   -- Continue HD per renal, f/u recs, may need CVVH given tenuous volume
   status
   .
   # B Cell Lymphoma - c/b tumor lysis syndrome
   -- holding any further chemotherapy
   -- continue neupogen
   -- f/u oncology recs
   -- trend ANC, daily diffs.
   -- check daily TL labs (LDH, K, PO4, uric), but will be managed at HD
   -- contiune allopurinol
   .
   # DM2 - on oral hypoglycemics as oupt.
   -- continue ISS, FSG qid, and DM diet
   .
   # Pain:
   -- 15mg MS contin
   -- Tylenol prn
   .
   # FEN:
   -- no further IVF if possible given ESRD, concern for pulm edema
   -- regular diet
   -- lyte repletion at HD

   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis now POD #2 s/p excision right basilic [**Hospital 13196**]
   transferred from OR intubated with transient hypotension.
   # SEPSIS, high grade VRE bactermemia [**2-3**] PICC. Blood cultures still
   turning positive. Fortunately, no blood cultures have turned positive
   since the OR suggesting a possible improvement by the white cell
   transfusion and removing this significant nidus of infection. If
   becomes bacteremic again will consider second white cell infusion
   and/or linezolid as further last-ditch efforts.
   - continue broad coverage antibiotics with daptomycin, zosyn, and
   voriconazole
   - continue surveillance cultures
   - f/u blood cultures, vein path from surgery
   - f/u ID recs
   # ARF, anuric: S/p HD x 1, repeating today per renal. Likely [**2-3**] ATN
   from hypotension vs gent
   - HD this pm pending line placement
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - If hypotensive again, recommend maintaining renal perfusion and
   correct metaboli acidosis with boluses D5 with bicarb
   - holding acyclovir
   # Intubation: Kept intubated for line placement and out of concern for
   mental status although ventilating well.
   - Monitor mental status and will not extubate until mental status
   clears such that pt can protect her airway
   # Acid-Base
   Has normal pH of 7.43 so likely has two primary disorders. Gap
   metabolic acidosis from renal failure. Respiratory alkalosis: maybe
   sepsis, partially compensatory for acidosis.
   - monitor
   # Mental status: Concerning as not on any sedation and BUN not that
   elevated and no improvement after HD x 1.
   - MRI head
   - Bedside EEG
   - Neurology consult, appreciate their input greatly
   - If not improved after second HD, will w/u further, consider LP
   # Hypotension:
   Improved with lifting of sedation
   - monitor
   #) Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia: Got another WBC transfusion.
   Patient is s/p hyper CVAD x 2, MEC and clofarabine and ara-C, now with
   persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and decreased ability to
   clear infection and bacteremia.
   - Monitor CBC w/diff after granulocyte infusion
   - maintain an active type and screen
   - transfuse for platelets<10,000 or any signs of bleeding and HCT<24
   - continue neupogen
   #) H/O positive PPD: continue prior regimen of moxifloxacin 400mg daily

   wound with entry through the left
   Occipital and exit via the right occipital.  Was at a party on [**2191-3-17**]
   and, per EMS report, fired a single shot to the head from a handgun.
   He was initially responsive with EMS, but by the time med flight
   arrived had a GCS of 3. At [**Hospital1 19**] ED he had an initial GCS of 3 with
   fixed/noncreative pupils bilaterally.  CT head showed a severe
   communized fracture of the skull. Pneumocephalus and fragments of both
   bone and shrapnel are seen in the occipital and parietal lobes. Right
   sided subdural hemorrhage. Suggestion of effacement of the sulci which
   would be compatible with diffuse cerebral edema. Bilateral large
   subgaleal hematoma. Over the course of 2 hours in the ED trauma bay,
   his neurological exam began to improve and he began to spontaneously
   move his bilateral lower extremities, & right upper extremity. His R
   pupil on re-examination was slightly reactive to light.  The decision
   was made to take him for the OR for emergent right craniectomy.

   Response:
   Neuro exam improving and post vent change ABG 7.46/37/134.  Lung sounds
   are clear after suctioning. Temp this pm 101.6.
   Plan:
   Continue q2hr neuro assessment and notify neurosurgery of any decline

   Overnight Events:
   - OSH records arrived re: previous cardiac history; [**Doctor First Name 11273**] has them
   - ~1645: pt became more dyspneic and agitated; tried restarting lasix
   gtt; got ABG but values were skewed because O2 was set too low at the
   time; CXR did not show any significant fluid overload
   - ~1815: pt continue with dyspnea and agitation; gave lasix bolus
   - ~1900: continued symptoms, also tachycardic and CVP up 10 ~16-18; EKG
   with no significant changes: ?afib with intermittent v-pacing; spoke
   with night nurse from last night and ended up increasing lasix bolus
   and giving 500 mg IV diuril (worked last night)
   - EP came to interrogate PM but pt was SOB, so will come back tomorrow
   - neurosurgery put in orders: start plavix 3 days post-procedure

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with PMHx of aortic stenosis s/p balloon
   valvuloplasty, transferred from the [**Hospital1 1896**] service to CCU for flash
   pulmonary edema.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Likely related to fluid overload/HF in the setting of aortic
   stenosis. The patient has a perisistent O2 requirement. She has
   desaturated to the mid 80s with self-d/c of oxygen in the setting of
   delirium. Lasix gtt off.
   - starting 20 mg PO lasix daily
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - recheck CXR
   - sputum cx, considering pt
s cough
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to diuresis in setting of severe aortic
   stenosis.
   - slow diuresis, as above, to prevent hypotension
   - holding amlodipine, lisinopril, isosorbide at this point
   - restarting metprolol to prevent tachycardia/hypertension and
   subsequent pulmonary edema
   .
   # CAD s/p Multiple Stents in the Past: Pt's current symptoms not likely
   related to ischemia, as she had a clean cath on [**2161-3-9**]. However, she
   did complain of some chest discomfort during her recent episode. Ruled
   out for ACS with three sets of CE
s. Had slight troponin bump (peak
   0.10) in setting of flash pulmonary edema, unlikely to be related to
   coronary occlusion.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, metoprolol and crestor
   .
   # Aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty: The patient is status post balloon
   valvuloplasty.  Possible candidate for percutaneous valve replacement
   in future.
   - monitor volume status
   - routine care of cath site
   - appreciate any interventional cardiology input
   .
   # UTI: Per [**Hospital1 **] notes, pt completed course of cipro and now has clean
   urine cx.
   .
   # OSTEOPOROSIS: Per [**Hospital1 1896**] notes, the pateint has been complaining of
   back pain, which was felt to be related to her previous vertebral
   fracture in the setting of lying on her back for days.
   - Continue vitamin D
   - Continue gabapentin
   - continue hydrocodone
   - appreciate PT recs

   APHASIA EVALUATION
   HISTORY
   Thank you for referring this 82 year old woman admitted on [**2161-3-18**] with
   for AVR and CABG performed on [**3-20**].  On [**3-24**] pt presented with 15
   minute episode of speech arrest, confusion, right facial droop and
   perioral numbness.  CT scan was without any evidence of intracranial
   hemorrhage, but there was evidence of white matter disease.  Neuro work
   up has suggested pt had TIA.  We were consulted to evaluate speech and
   language function to initiate speech therapy.  Per RNs, pt frustrated
   with speech deficits and anxious about her current decline.
   EVALUATION
   Performed using portions of an Informal Cognitive-Communication
   Evaluation.
   ORIENTATION/ATTENTION
   Pt is oriented to self, DOB, age, home town, and occupation (\"retired\")
   but cannot tell her previous occupation due to word finding deficits.
   Oriented to place and city, though requires forced choice/field of 3
   due to speech deficits.  Oriented to month independently, year in field
   of 3, and date with visual cue for wall calendar.
   RECEPTIVE LANGUAGE
   Pt answers factual y/n questions of increasing difficulty with 90%
   accuracy.  One error was due to misunderstanding of pronoun (\"yours\"
   vs. \"my\").  Pt able to identify pictures of familiar objects by
   pointing with ease.  Followed one step commands with 100% accuracy, 2
   step commands with 66% accuracy, and 3 step commands with 33%
   accuracy.  Errors were suggestive of primacy effect, recalling only the
   first portion of the direction.  Pt was asked factual questions about a
   3 sentence story, which she answered with only 50% accuracy.
   EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE
   Pt's naming of high frequency items (e.g., nose, key, eyes, sheet) was
   accurate, though marked by frequent semantic and paraphasic errors
   (e.g., \"nelvo\" and \"elbell\"/elbow; \"sing\"/ring; \"[**Doctor Last Name **]\"/table).
   Repetition at the word and [**2-11**] word phrase level was WNL, though with
   increasing length pt's accuracy broke down.  For example, when asked to
   repeat THE TELEPHONE IS RINGING, pt produced \"the telephone is exc...
   oh boy, the section is... I can hear it but no [points to head].\"  With
   backwards chaining on same sentence, pt can produce \"ringing,\" \"is
   ringing,\" \"section is ringing.\"  Automatized sequences were challenging
   to get into set, but WFL once pt started.  For example, when asked to
   count [**1-28**], pt initially counted from 10-100 in sets of 10 (\"10, 20,
   30...\").  After written cue of [**1-10**]-3-4-5, pt able to produce [**1-28**] with
   ease.  Required cue for first word in DOY and [**Doctor Last Name 8020**], but then produced
   all independently.
   In conversational speech, pt's language was fluent with 7+ word
   utterances, though marked by frequent semantic and phonemic
   paraphasias, similar to those found in more highly structured tasks
   above.  She is aware of deficits, frequently giving up and saying \"I
   don't know\" or \"I can't\" rather than producing the errors.
   [**Location (un) **]
   [**Location (un) **] at the word level was 90% accurate with only error of \"adge\"
   for BADGE.  When cued to read that word again, produced it correctly.
   Did not assess [**Location (un) **] at the sentence or paragraph level.
   WRITING
   Pt asked to write her name, produced \"Belel DiRilenzo.\"  Named high
   frequency items in written form accurately including \"book\" \"key\" and
   \"ring,\" though always reauditorized the instruction prior to writing.
   Did not assess written language at sentence or paragraph level.
   SPEECH/VOICE
   Able to produce many actions accurately to r/o limb apraxia, though
   always reauditorizes the instruction before producing the action.  Also
   able to produce oral motor tasks to r/o oral apraxia (e.g., bite an
   apple, lick milk off lip, blow out candle, cough, sip through straw,
   sniff a flower).
   When asked to produce 3 syllable words, pt produced many articulation
   errors on first imitation (e.g., \"sippering\"/zippering,
   \"soapingly\"/hopefully, \"strethening\"/strengthening,
   \"sofeling\"/softening)  When attempting to forward-chain to increase
   accuracy, pt's performance improved but continued with articulation
   deficits, possibly an apraxic component that cannot be ruled out in
   setting of frequent phonemic paraphasias.
   SUMMARY/IMPRESSION
   Pt presents with deficits across communication areas screened today
   including receptive language, expressive language, [**Location (un) **], and
   writing.  Deficits are most notably characterized currently by frequent
   phonemic and semantic paraphasias.  She is able to improve accuracy
   with phonemic cues and occasionally benefits from backwards and
   forwards chaining of syllables.  Education provided today on aphasia
   and course of care which could include both inpatient and outpatient
   therapy.  Currently patient is coping well for her language deficits
   and is using gestures to maximize communication of wants/needs with
   medical staff.  As such, speech therapy may be more beneficial if
   deferred to a rehab setting in which she can receive more detailed
   assessment followed by intensive intervention.
   Currently, she'll benefit from continued education regarding her
   deficits and course of recovery to ease her anxiety.  She'll also
   benefit from written cues when able to improve comprehension, keeping
   instructions short ([**1-10**] steps max), and providing forced choice/field
   of 3 to assist with her expressive output (e.g., \"Do you want eggs,
   pancakes, or oatmeal?\").
   We will continue to follow, as able.  If there are specific questions
   or needs, please page or reconsult.

   According to patient, the night prior to presenting to [**Location (un) **], she
   slept with her oxygen disconnected. That morning, she felt
   significantly SOB and presented to [**Hospital3 **]. At [**Location (un) **] she was
   hypoxic to the 60s on RA which improve to 92-95 on 5L. She was also
   tachycardic with HRs in 120s-140s and EKG showed NSTTW changes. CXR
   showed a possible RML infiltrate, labs revealed leukocytosis to 24K,
   CK/Trop 56/0.16. She received Solumedrol, Levaquin, and Amiodarone and
   was transferred to MICU at [**Hospital1 1**] for futher care.
   .
   At [**Hospital1 1**], the hypoxia was felt due to a combination of COPD flare
   precipitated by a prolonged period without her regular oxygen as well
   as possible flash pulmonary edema in the setting of htn and
   tachycardia. She was initially treated for bronchitis vs pna with
   vanc/zosyn and was quickly changed to levofloxacin. She also received
   20 mg of IV lasix. She was continued on a slow prednisone taper and
   her symptoms slowly improved and she was weaned to her baseline 3LNC.
   Her elevated cardiac enzymes were attributed to demand ischemia in the
   setting of tachycardia and hypoxia. Cardiac enzymes trended down and pt
   remained asymptomatic. ECHO showed mildly depressed LVEF of 50% and
   apical RV akinesis.  Pt was transferred to the floor and continued to
   have issues with sob, anxiety and issues with constipation.

   1. Pulmonary emboli involving the right main pulmonary artery, right
   upper
   lobar/segmental pulmonary artery, and right middle lobe segmental
   pulmonary
   artery. Please note, there are likely acute-on-chronic pulmonary emboli
   given
   the eccentric nature of the filling defects with evidence of
   recanalization
   through portions of the filling defects.
   2. Emphysema with parenchymal ground-glass opacities most apparent in
   the
   right upper lobe suggestive of advanced respiratory bronchiolitis.
   3. 6-mm left lower lobe nodule, for which followup in [**7-18**] months is
   advised.

   This is a 53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG
   who presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis - Patient meets SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR, and initial
   PaCO2.  Likely source is pneumonia +/ skin infection +/ c.diff
   colitis.
   - Treat empirically for pneumonia with vanc, zosyn, levoflox
   - Sputum cxs, urine legionella Ag
   - Treat empirically for c.diff colitis with flagyl
   - Check c.diff toxin
   - KUB to evaluate for toxic megacolon/perforation
   - Check plain films of right foot to r/o extension into bone
   - Vanco and zosyn should also cover for diabetic foot ulcer
   - Arterial line for close hemodynamic monitoring
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   .
   # WCT - Concerning for VT versus SVT with aberrancy.  Currently in NSR
   on amiodarone gtt.  Of note QTc prolonged, will need to monitor, esp on
   levofloxacin.
   - Cycle cardiac markers
   - ECG in AM
   - Continue amiodarone for now
   - Cardiology c/s in AM
   .
   # Respiratory - Intubated for lethargy and ? acidosis.
   - A-line
   - ABG
   - Wean O2 as needed
   - Pressure support tomorrow if hemodynamics improved
   .
   # DKA - Secondary to infection.  AG now closed.  Will continue on
   insulin gtt for now given very elevated FSGs.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now
   - Q2 hour FSG checks
   - Correct electrolytes
   - Change to ISS when FSG improved
   .
   # Hyponatremia - Maybe secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of
   diarrhea.  Legionella also possible.
   - Urine lytes, osm
   - Cont trend following hydration
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Sepsis is possible etiology.  Too early to be
   HIT.
   - Check DIC labs
   - Meds reviewed
   - Obtain baseline plt count

   Imaging: CXR [**2-22**] - AP PORTABLE CHEST: This study is markedly limited
   by patient positioning and
   large body habitus. A new left subclavian venous catheter can be traced
   to
   the level of the left brachiocephalic vein, after which it is
   obscured.
   Pneumothorax cannot be excluded on this study which does not include a
   large
   portion of the left hemithorax. Right PICC remains with termination in
   the
   SVC. Tracheostomy not grossly changed.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F with history of COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, dCHF,
   DM2, HTN, who was recently admitted for hypoxic/hypercarbic resp
   failure s/p trach/peg, now readmitted to the MICU from rehab with
   fevers, bacteremia and abdominal pain.
   .
   # Fevers/Abdominal Pain: Patient
s abdominal exam is progressing, now
   with rebound and guarding with persistent high fevers. C diff is
   positive. Other culture data still pending, but dirty UA, sputum
   culture with GPC
s, GNR
s (but likely resp flora), and staph (likely
   epi) on blood cultures. That being said, her clinical picture is most
   consistent with c diff colitis, wbc is trending up.
   - stat KUB, surgery c/s
   - serial abdominal exams
   - add PO vanco to PO flagyl
   - continue vanco for staph epi bacteremia, follow repeat cultures
   - will need to pull picc and place CVL
   - Send UA, urine culture
   - would continue levofloxacin for now
   - cooling blanket, tylenol prn
   - IVF
   # Hypernatremia: Will need free water flushes through the peg plus [**1-11**]
   NS to replete free water deficit of 8.5L. Sodium is trending down
   slowly with
 NS @ 200cc per hour. Will need to continue for total of 6
   L today (plus free water boluses).
   - check sodium at 5pm.
   # ARF: creatinine continues to trend down with IVF, initial insult was
   ATN
   - monitor UOP
   - free water repletion
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   # Chronic Respiratory Failure - on vent, VBG indicates that we can go
   up on Tv and peep.
   - MDI's, trach care, suctioning
   - recheck VBG after vent changes.
   # COPD - continue MDI's as above
   # dCHF - is free water down, overall. Will need IVF. Watch sats and
   vent settings for evidence of pulmonary edema..
   # DM2: insulin SS
   .
   # Skin: recovering from drug rash. Wound c/s.
   # FEN: needs free water. replete lytes prn. Can try TF's but will
   likely need to hold given abd pain and unclear source of fever.
   # PPX
   - DVT: SC heparin 7500 TID, PPI
   - Stress ulcer: PPI

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension,
   transferred to the unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of
   anticoagulation complicated by hypotension, ARF, and shock liver.
   .
   # Coffee ground emesis - Likely upper GI source in setting of
   supra-therapeutic INR, ddx includes PUD, ASA-induced gastritis,
   malignancy.  Hepatic injury may be contributing to coagulopathy with
   INR persistently high.
   - defer EGD for now given cardiac ischemia, hypotension, coagulopathy
   - Hct stable since yesterday, increase to [**Hospital1 **] checks
   - continue PPI gtt for 72 hours (d/c at noon)
   - consider d/c NGT, advancing diet
   - f/u GI recs
   - access 2 PIV, a-line, central line
   - hold ASA, coumadin
   - Give IV vitamin K, consider additional [**Location 6725**]
   # Hypotension- Patient is 6.5 L up over LOS.  Was started on levophed
   yesterday but developed afib, switched to neo and afib terminated on
   its own without need to rate control.
   - goal MAP>60 and UOP >30 cc/hr
   - follow perfusion status clinically with UOP, mentation, skin exam
   - ECG this am
   - continue monitoring on tele
   # A-fib with RVR- likely due to levophed, changed to neo
   - monitor and EKG as above
   # Acute Renal Failure- Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs, no
   need for renal replacement therapy at this time.  Cre continues to
   climb.  Urine without eos, + few granular casts.  Urine lytes yesterday
   c/w pre-renal azotemia also likely from hypotension.  UOP improved
   somewhat with pressors.
   - continue neo
   - per renal recs: consider DDAVP if further bleed for uremic plt,
   - gentle IVF given EF
   # Demand Ischemia/Heart Failure- CPK trending down.  TTE yesterday
   reveals stable EF 25%.
   - trend CK, CPK
   - volume repletion and neo as above to goal MAP >60, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - monitor on telemetry
   - anticoagulation on hold for now
   # Transaminitis- Likely shock liver with transaminitis improving.  ERCP
   service consulted, however pt not felt likely to tolerate ERCP now and
   RUQ u/s was repeated showing slightly improved picture.
   - f/u Liver recs
   - trend LFT's, amylase, lipase
   #DM
   - hold glyburide while inpatient
   - RISS

   1. There is dilatation and distention of the esophagus around a gastric
   tube. Given the extensive inflammatory change in the right middle lobe
   in particular, aspiration must be considered.
   2. Compared to the most recent cross-sectional study, the CT
   examination of [**2155-4-16**] there has been interval mild progression of
   ascites and bilateral pleural effusions.
   3. Diffuse small bowel dilatation is identified. There is no evidence
   of pneumatosis nor of a transition point. In the colon there Appears to

   Assessment and Plan
   53M with HIV/hepC, admitted with nausea, weakness, hypotension.
   # Sepsis/altered mental status: No focal neurologic deficits, and no
   witnessed seizure activity at home.  Continues to have mild tremor, but
   no frank asterixis.  Most concerning for infection given his distended
   abdomen, leukocytosis, and colitis seen on imaging; also question of
   pneumonia (?aspiration).  Has maintained pressures with IVF overnight.
   - F/u ucx, bcx, stool cx with cdiff, DFA for influenza
   - U/s guided diagnostic paracentesis today with FFP beforehand
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl empirically for presumed
   abdominal/pulmonary source; d/c azithromycin as legionella neg. Could
   consider transition to cipro tmrw if cont to be stable with neg micro.
   - Consider thoracentesis but less likely infectious source
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin (if diarrhea resolves), for possible
   encephalopathy complicating picture.
   - Seizure precautions.
   # Hypoxia: Presented with cough with worsening hypoxia in setting of
   aggressive fluid repletion.  CT chest with substantial pleural effusion
   and compressive atelectasis v. pneumonia (less likely)
 most
   concerning for aspiration by hx. Continues to required O2
   supplementation
   - Wean O2 as able
   - DFA to r/o flu
   - Continue vanc/zosyn.
   - F/u ID recs.
   - Pleural effusion less likely empyema; could consider thoracentesis
   for therapeutic rather than diagnostic value.
   # Elevated lactate: CT abd without evidence of ischemia. [**Month (only) 11**] have
   regional hypoperfusion v. [**12-30**] liver failure. Sepsis also on
   differential. HIV meds can also raise lactate (abacavir, lamivudine ->
   neutral [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Doctor Last Name **], tenofovir -> not [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Doctor Last Name **]). Slowly trending down
   after 9 L IVF overnight.
   - trend lactate Q6H.
   - follow UOP closely.
   - Hold HAART.
   - F/u ID recs for sepsis.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely [**12-30**] septic picture and possibly complicated by
   ESLD.
   - D5/NS fluids.
   - Check FSBS QID.
   # ESLD: [**12-30**] hepC, h/o encephalopathy with varices, no h/o SBP, HRS.
   Off of transplant list [**12-30**] pHTN. albumin 2.6.  MELD 23.
   - F/u Liver recs.
   - Lactulose being held for loose stools, cont rifaximin.
   - Hold propanalol given hypotension.
   - Discuss diuretics with liver team as apparently poor response in the
   past, will hold off for now given hypotension.
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 0.9, presented at 1.2 and now trending down to 1.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be [**12-30**] volume depletion in setting of sepsis, or contrast-induced;
   received bicarb and mucomyst.
   - check urine lytes now as he has received 5L IVF in ED.
   - consider albumin.
   - Has received bicarb and mucomyst
   - trend creatinine.
   # ?Seizure: Unclear history of bowel/bladder incontinence which is new
   for patient, though he wears depends at baseline.  no focal neurologic
   deficits presently, but hypoglycemia may have contributed.
   - seizure precautions.
   - follow finger sticks closley.
   - Ativan 2 mg IV push if seizure activity in absence of hypoglycemia.
   # HIV: CD4 300s, VL undetectable.  concern for elevated lactate [**12-30**] HIV
   meds.  should also consider opportunistic pathogens.
   - hold home regimen for now.
   - ID consult as above.
   # Pulmonary HTN: not yet on sildenafil as outpatient.

   pericardial effusion and early tamponade.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Patient is s/p pericardiocentesis [**5-29**] and s/p
   pericardial window via video assisted thoracotomy [**5-30**].  Given
   thickened appearance of pericardium thoracics unclear if window
   complete, but pt has remained stable overnight. ECHO showed
   organization of effusion. No tamponade. Again, we feel etiology of
   recurrent pericardial fluid reaccumulation is recent [**Doctor First Name **] vs XRT,
   however pericardial fluid did show rare atypical cells in background og
   reactive cells. Pt did not require PCA overnight

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension,
   transferred to the unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of
   anticoagulation complicated by hypotension, ARF, and shock liver.
   # Coffee ground emesis: Likely upper GI source in setting of
   supra-therapeutic INR, ddx includes PUD, ASA-induced gastritis,
   malignancy.  Hepatic injury may be contributing to coagulopathy with
   INR persistently high.
   - Hct stable since yesterday, decrease to daily checks
   - Defer EGD for now given stable Hct in setting of cardiac ischemia,
   hypotension, coagulopathy
   - Continue PPI gtt for 72 hours, then change to IV bid
   - Access 2 PIV, a-line, central line
   - D/c NGT, advance diet
   - Holding ASA, coumadin
   - Consider DDAVP if further bleed for uremic plt per Renal
   - Give FFP x 2 units
   - F/u GI recs
   # Hypotension:  Cardiogenic v. hypovolemic v. distributive. Was started
   on levophed yesterday but developed afib, switched to neo; afib
   terminated on its own without need to rate control.
   - Will receive volume with FFP; allow po fluid intake but caution in
   setting of EF 25%
   - Hope to be able to wean neo with improvement in fluid status; goal
   MAP>60 and UOP >30 cc/hr
   - Follow perfusion status clinically with UOP, mentation, skin exam,
   CvO2
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Likely in setting of levophed,
   changed to neo.
   - Appreciate cards recs
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs, no
   need for renal replacement therapy at this time.  Cre continues to
   climb.  Urine without eos, + few granular casts.  Urine lytes yesterday
   c/w pre-renal azotemia also likely from hypotension.  UOP improved
   somewhat with pressors.
   - Liberalize po fluid intake today
   - Monitor U/O
   - Wean pressor as tolerated
   # Demand Ischemia/Heart Failure: CPK trending down.  Very elevated BNP
   yesterday. TTE showed stable EF 25%.
   - Trend CK, CPK daily
   - Recheck BNP
   - Volume repletion and neo as above to goal MAP >60, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Anticoagulation on hold for now
   # Transaminitis- Likely shock liver with transaminitis improving.  ERCP
   service consulted, however pt not felt likely to tolerate ERCP now and
   RUQ u/s was repeated showing slightly improved picture.
   - F/u Liver recs
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   #DM
   - Hold glyburide while inpatient
   - RISS

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - breathing dysynchronous with ventilator on AC yesterday, patient on
   trial of PS with higher tidal volumes than indicated by ARDS protocol;
   had rising CO2 yesterday afternoon and had to be placed back on ACV .
   Early this morning he was back on pressure support [**12-24**], was pulling
   tidal volumes around 600cc, and had an ABG of 7.32/60/113. However,
   patient appeared dyspneic with retractions and nasal flaring and
   admitted to having difficulty breathing. So sedation was increased and
   he was placed back on AC.
   - BMT following for chemotherapy, keep urine output > 100 cc/hr
   - confirmed Burkitt's lymphoma per bone marrow biopsy

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, starting chemotherapy for
   Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], one failed extubation on [**7-15**]
   secondary to copious secretions. Dysonchronous with vent on AC
   requiring significant sedation. PS trials have resulted in either
   acidemia down to 7.12 or dyspnea as patient is requiring minute
   ventilations around 13-15. Contributing factors to respiratory status
   include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as
   well as meeting ARDS criteria starting [**7-18**].
   -continue trials of pressure support to see how it is tolerated. Goal
   is to maximize comfort level and minimize dysynchrony while keeping
   ph>7.20, C02<70.
   -Despite meeting ARDS definition, lung compliance has remained high, so
   large tidal volumes ok to maximize comfort and achieve the high minute
   ventilation he is requiring.
   -leave propofol off if possible
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   -Daily breathing trials in the morning to work toward extubation.
   Limiting factors now include mental status, gag/secretions/resolution
   of PNA and will be ok to wait as he is receiving high dose chemotherapy
   right now.
   -Daily CXR
   -Abx: Continue vanco (day 10, start [**7-13**]) and cipro (day 4,start [**7-19**]).
   meropenem (day 3, start [**7-20**]) to be discussed with ID (see below)
   -per ID, added fluconazole 400mg IV daily for ppx given
   immunosuppression
   - cryptococcal serology negative
   -f/u final BAL results and blood cx
   -per ethics, ok to proceed with HIV test/CD4 count
   -CXR today indicates possible volume overload, plan to diurese to
   maintain UOP
   Tumor lysis/lymphoma: : Labs at admission included significantly
   elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia,
   hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor lysis syndrome. All trended
   down for several days until LDH bumped again startng [**7-17**]. s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma and hyper-CVAD started on [**7-21**]
   beginning with cyclophosphamide.
   -f/u with heme/onc regarding recs, safety of methotrexate today in
   light of bilateral pleural effusions
   -new thrombocytopenia and leukopenia today, unlikely to be a side
   effect of chemo this early. Talk to ID regarding stopping meropenem
   and/or bactrim as a possible cause. Allopurinol also a potential
   suspect.
   -maintain UOP of 100cc/hr, touch base with onc to see if this is ok if
   we achieve it with lasix drip in place of IVF
   -continue allopurinol for now, although could consider stopping in
   light of low platelets, WBC
   -trend tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -dexamethasone 40mg daily
   -PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
 ?switch from bactrim in light of pancytopenia
   -daily differential
   -EBV PCR pending
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -increased comfort on PS yesterday showed less tachycardia, HR in 90s.
   has persisted around 100 even back on AC
   -decrease metoprolol to 50mg Q6H
   Anemia: Most likely secondary to bone marrow crowding from lymphoma.
   s/p 1 unit PRBCs on [**7-16**]. Hct stable around 24.
   -transfuse at Hct<21
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   ARF, resolved: Cre bumped early in admission from 0.6 baseline to peak
   1.6. Trended down and now stable at 0.5. Thought to be secondary to ATN
   from tumor lysis with a possible contribution from presenting symptom
   of urinary retention.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -maintain 100cc/hr of urine output while on chemo
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. One small stool in last 48 hrs.
   -residuals on tube feeds about 60
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -consider PO narcan if worsens
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl
   Social:
   -social work consulted
   -family meeting Friday pm (endocrine available between 12 and 2pm),
   contact family to ensure their presence and request onc
s presence as

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 40M ARDS, lymphoma, acromegaly, tumor lysis
   syndrome. Chemo started yesterday, tolerated transition to PSV for
   better synchrony. ABGs 7.33 / 31 / 85 - 7.32 / 60 / 113 on PSV.
   Exam notable for Tm 101.2 BP 100/40 HR 90-110 RR 33 with sat 98 on VAC
   500x28 10 0.5. Follows commands. Frontal bossing. Coarse BS c long exp
   phase. Hyperdynamic s1s2. Soft +BS. 2+ edema. Labs notable for WBC 3K,
   HCT 24, K+ 4.9, Cr 0.5. CXR with B ASD, inc RLL.
   Agree with plan to transition to PSV 16/10 for ARDS, with plan to
   continue to reduce sedation as able. Given increased volume on CXR,
   will start lasix gtt and decrease IVF / BBL today. Will continue vanco,
   [**Last Name (un) **], and cipro for nosocomial aspiration / VAP, and will treat with
   fluconazole while awaiting BAL yeast cx results. Needs HIV test today -
   we have confirmed that ethics agrees with this decision, and will fax
   request to the lab. Will continue chemo today but need to discuss MTX
   given pleural effusions on CXR; will continue to treat tumor lysis with
   dex and allopurinol. WBC and plts are falling - continue to monitor,
   stop SC heparin. Endocrine following for acromegaly / macroadenoma, no
   immediate plans for treatment; no evidence of pituitary hypofunction at
   this point. Will continue PCP prophylaxis while on high dose steroids.
   Continue TFs, no BM yesterday - will wean fent as able and consider PO
   narcan. Family will be here Friday afternoon. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital), most
   likely representing progression of his NHBCL now s/p bx on CVVHD to

   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.

   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 63M renal tx, PTLD, CNS lymphoma - off CVVH

   notable for WBC 13K, HCT 22, K+ 3.5, Cr 1.0. CXR with progressive
   volume overload. UCx enterococcus.
   Agree with plan to manage CNS lymphoma with MTX / leukovorin - now off
   RRT. For renal tx, will adjust sirolimus to level with renal xplant
   guidance, and will discuss gentle diuresis for volume overload. For
   cough sputum production, will check GS/C+S and f/u CXR, hold off on CT
   as I suspect much of this is volume overload. For enterococcal UTI,
   will ask ID for vanco approval. Plts still falling off heparin, await
   HIT. Follow HCT s/p xfusion. Brain bx site is c/d/i. Lantus adjusted
   down for hypoglycemia. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of transformed
   non-Hodgkin lymphoma, now in remission x 5 years (s/p autologous stem
   cell transplant), hereditary hemochromatosis and psoriatic arthritis
   who presents with headaches, myalgias, rash and fevers. Presumptive
   diagnosis is Lyme disease.
   .
   #Septic shock: Hypotension resolved on admission to MICU with pressors
   discontinued at 8am on [**8-18**]. Vital signs have been stable since with no
   hypotension, CVPs at 10, and he is afebrile. Presumptive source is Lyme
   disease, stage 2, early disseminated.
   --advance diet as tolerated, no maintenance IVF needed
   --will follow-up all blood, urine cultures
   --talk to ID: would like to d/c CTX because of lack of suspicion of CNS
   involvement and continue doxycycline 100mg IV BID, particularly because
   he can go home if on oral meds and these two treatments have been shown
   to be equivocal in early disseminated lyme.
   --f/u with ID as an outpatient. Lyme, babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis
   serologies still pending
   .
   #Headaches: Resolving. Likely will continue to resolve with treatment
   of Lyme disease..

   Action:
   Increased PCA dose for better pain control, given tramadol as ordered,
   assisted to ambulate to the commode, foley removed, given sips of water
   to drink.
   Response:
   Patient reports that sometimes her pain gets very bad and she states
   that she feels that the PCA is not always enough for her pain. Reports
   pain is constant at baseline. Pt had one small soft bowel movement in

   of diaphragmatic pacing, second arrest in [**2134**] in the setting of Biaxin
   administration, generator replacement in [**12/2138**], presented for RV
   pacing lead extraction after RV impedence increased to 1000 ohms last
   week.  Found to have fractured lead. PMH of COPD on inhalors.
   Procedure performed [**8-15**].  ICD and pacemaker lead from [**2133**] were
   removed (atrial lead still in place).  New ICD lead placed  under
   general anesthesia.  The removal of the 2 RV lead was difficult and due
   to skin erosion the new device was placed under the muscle, requiring a
   great deal of manipulation. She had estimated 250cc blood loss. A
   0.5-0.8cm pericardial effusion was noted during procedure- no change in
   size from prior.  Admitted to CCU for monitoring of hypotension.

   stabilized to 90-s and her urine output picked up.  She has developed
   far more eccyhmosis distal to wound in breast and L arm.  She is eating
   and drinking without problem. RENAL: She is autodiuresing and dropped
   from 3 to 2 liters positive. Despite hypotension BUN/creat stable.  ID:
   Has had low grade fever, which have resolved. She continues on PO
   kefzol TID X 7 days post pacer placement, and vancomycin IV added to
   cover blood in tissue.

   cardiac meds have been held. HR trending up to low 100s, ST. Crit
   drifted down to 27.5 (29.7). Pt now autodiuresing. She continues to
   feel good. Breast  and left arm continue to be edematous. She has minor
   pedal edema. She is up 2 kilos since admission.
   Action:
   12.5 mg Lopressor re-started ( half home dose ). Lisinopril and
   torsemide continue to be held. She is OOB with minimal assist and has
   been walking in the hallway, maintaining BP.
   Response:
   BP and urine output are stabe post lopressor.  . Her lungs remain clear
   although decreased at the bases. She appears to have increasing lower
   extremity edema and increasing edema in L arm.

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yom Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, s/p DKA and mild UGIB., now
   with progressive right atalectasis and respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- stable s/p extubation.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- evidence for acute by CT scan.  Plan trial of
   lovenox and placement of IVC filter.  Check LE NIVS to assess for
   persistent source.
   DELIRIUM -- initally attributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state), and witholding of usual
   psychiatric medications.  Since extubation, now resuming usual PO
   meds.
   TACHYCARDIA -- likely multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   hypovolemia, anxiety.  Also consider pericardial involvement by lung
   cancer.
   DKA
 improved, but remains on insulin drip.  Plan to transition to
   subcutaneous insulin.  [**Last Name (un) 294**] Consultation in progress.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.  Monitor uo,
   creatinine.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   NSCLC, stage IV- Right pleural effusion, now with right lung
   atalectasis due to extrinsic compression.   Recent chemotherapy,
   ?palliative.

 Weekend
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7467**], including the assessment and plan. I would
   emphasize and add the following points:
   Events: self-extubated on rounds, post ABG 7.51/25/67.  Subsequently
   self-d/c
d NGT tube.
   Started on dexamethasone, restarted on lovenox for DVT after discussion
   with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**].
   Developed macular rash on face and chest.
   Tm 100.6 P100
s BP 140/90s. Sat 100% on RA.
   I/O: 2.5L/2.4L
   Exam notable for sutured L eyelid, B/L pupils reactive.  Verbal and
   withdrawal response to pain in all 4
   Lungs coarse b/l.  Abd scaphoid and soft.  Rash minimal, improved per
   report.
   Labs reviewed.  Cultures reviewed; CSF and blood NGTD.
   Meds include Vanc, cefepime, acyclovir, dexamethasone, metoprolol,
   lovenox
   41 y/o with acromegaly and high grade B cell lymphoma with likely CNS
   recurrence.
   Agree with plan for brain XRT tomorrow per neuro-onc; will d/c acylovir
   given CSF results and predominance of likely malignant cells with low
   suspicion of HSV.
   Resp status stable after extubation though mental status remains very
   poor
 will remain in ICU for now.  Continue Vanc/Cefepime course for
   HAP.  Repeat ABG today to confirm that PCO2 is stable.
   Needs nutritional support
 attempted placement of NGT yest
   unsuccessful d/t pt resistance; though hopefully mental status will
   improve with treatment would consider repeat attempt at NGT vs Gtube.
   Remainder of plan per ICU team.
   Pt is critically ill.  CC time 35 minutes.

 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - Appreicate BMT input
   - Appreciate neuro/onc input
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI
   - Continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**]
   - d/c Acyclovir as per neuro did not suggest it and it seems this is
   lymphoma according to LP
   - send VBG
   # Respiratory failure/Coag + Staph sputum: Sputum and consolidation on
   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH
   - f/u sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 3 of 10
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Patient is reportedly in remission
   after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD methotrexate, and intrathecal
   methotrexate but LP suggests that he is having recurrence.
   - Appreciate multiple consulting services
   - FU LP results
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate, Contact [**Name (NI) **]-Onc early Monday
   #. Rash: likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing.  Likely related to increased ICP
   given high opening LP pressure.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron and dexamethasone
   - bolus 1L now then start maintenance fluids as not taking good PO
   - IV phos
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left
   ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TTE here without change from previous except dynamic LV
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care recs applied
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: ?PEG in near future, will readdress tomorrow as not taking
   good PO

   Chest CT: improvement in previous mulitfocal infiltrate and atelectasis
   Assessment and Plan
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   55 y/o M s/p ACD (anterior cervical discectomy) on [**2179-3-7**], course
   complicated by prevertebral hematoma s/p drain. Recently with concern
   for epidural bleed causing cord compression, but also hypoxia.
   1.       Hypoxia- has had fluctuating oxygen requirements independent
   of intervention- on 4 liters n.c. shortly after ICU transfer, up to [**Date Range 1351**]
   overnight. Overnight hypoxia may have been partly aggravated by
   transportation. Also unclear that pt definitely needed a [**Name (NI) 1351**] as he
   found the other oxygen masks uncomfortable.
           His chest CT showed improvement in infiltrates, and the degree
   of parenchymal disease was rather underwhelming relative to his oxygen
   requirement. Possible that the intermittent hypoxia represents ongoing
   PE (though note that the initial CTA was equivocal, with the only
   definite defect being one subsegmental PE). Another possibility, given
   lack of subjective dyspnea, is that he has some atelectasis/shunting.
       Will continue Vanc/zosyn for HCAP to complete an 8 day course,
   remains on heparin gtt. Would try to get pt OOB, and wean down oxygen
   as able.
   2.       Right sided weakness- MRI images reviewed by neurology without
   clear cord compression seen.  Will discuss further eval with consult
   team.

   diagnosed [**11-5**] s/p whipple [**11-5**] who presents to ED with fever to
   102.8. Patient had a similar admission in [**8-6**] here for similar
   reasons. Both times, the fever started shortly after port access.
   During his admission in [**Month (only) 338**], no positive blood cultures, negative
   urine cx, negative cxr, negative echo. Was diagnosed with
   supraventricular tacchycardia and was given adenosine and then
   lopressor to take at home. He was treated with vanc and ceftriaxone and
   then ciprofloxacin and improved. He usually feels ill about 48 hours
   after port access for chemotherapy but it is unclear if this is the
   chemotherapy or infection.  The port was placed at [**Hospital1 12**] in [**Month (only) **]. On
   Monday, he had his port accessed for labs and he began to feel like he
   was \"coming down with a cold\" on Tuesday afternoon. He went to work on
   [**10-6**] and around noon felt weak, developed abdominal pain radiating to
   his left shoulder, one episode of vomiting and low grade temp to 99. He
   went to the ED where his temperature rose to 102.9 and he experienced
   rigors.
   In the ED, vs. were 99.4 111 117/70 16 96% RA initially. Mild
   epigastric tenderness. Guaic He received 4 liters IVF. CXR negative. HR
   130s. EKG showed sinus tacchycardia. Received lovenox for ? PE since he
   couldn
t get CTA because of contrast allergy.  Temperature rose to
   102.8, given tylenol. Received vanc and levaquin. Shortly after
   receiving the abx, his lips swelled and he developed hives. He received
   benadryl and pepcid and this resolved. He has received those
   antibiotics multiple times in the past and has never had a reaction. Of
   note, per wife, the vanco was given slowly so red man syndrome less
   likely.
   Plan for today is for pt to go to OR to have port removed under local
   anesthesia. Pt has tentative time 3PM-4PM. Pt also needs abdominal MRI
   which has tentative time 5PM-6PM. Pt aware of these plans. He is NPO
   except for meds, remains alert and oriented times three, visited with
   his wife and friends this AM. Took PO linezolid as ordered.
   He remains afebrile today. He needs to have blood culture and fungal
   isolator blood culture sent from his port when the port is taken out in
   the OR. He also needs to have tip sent for culture. Blood culture
   bottles and order for blood cultures are on his bedside table in his
   room.
   Fever (Hyperthermia, Pyrexia, not Fever of Unknown Origin)
   Assessment:
   Pt afebrile so far today. CXR shows new infiltrates R>L and pt seems to
   desaturate with activity. He denies SOB.
   Action:
   Continues on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   Response:
   Afebrile
   Plan:
   Plan to go to OR for removal of port, cultures to be sent from port
   andplan to remain in ICU overnight due to new bilateral infiltrates. Pt
   also to have MRI of his abdomen early this evening.
   Hypertension, benign
   Assessment:
   Pt
s BP 130-140.70. HR 90-110 off Lopressor at present.
   Action:
   Following vital signs closely
   Response:
   Stable vital signs so far this day.
   Plan:
   Continue to follow vital signs closely. Pt will need to be monitored
   when he goes off the floor because he is not on his Lopressor die to
   episode of hypotension with fever on admission.

 SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE)
   Ms [**Known lastname 4188**] is a 21-y/o F w h/o SLE c/b nephritis, pleural and pericardial
   effusions, s/p recent 1-month-long admission at OSH for lupus flare,
   who now presented with new-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures x3
   at home and was found to have multiterritorial strokes, pericardial
   effusion w tamponade physiology as well as intraabdominal bleed.
   Currently consulting: rheum, neuro, nephro, heme, urology, ob/gyn,
   vascular surgery; nutrition.
   # SLE: Complicated by nephritis and pleural/pericardial effusions.
   Concerning for associated thromboembolic disease with brain infarcts.
   Rheum considering cyclophosphamide vs cell cept.
   - Appreciate rheumatology and Gyn recommendations
   - prednisone 50mg daily
   - considering cytoxan, likely to start this week, awaiting pts choice
   - monitor c3/c4 levels for flare- pending
   - will start atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis, pending G6PD
   # Myopericarditis with pericardial effusion: Dilated CMP w decreased
   LVEF 20-30%. Most likely lupus-induced myopericarditis. No clinical or
   echocariographic evidnece of tamponade, although effusion is larger.
   - if pt developed symptoms, repeat echocardiogram to determine if
   pericardiocentesis or window is indicated,
   - consider afterload reduction with low dose lisinopril, holding in
   setting of acute renal failure.
   - now on prednisone 50mg per day
   # SOB/acute systolic CHF-  Improved with furosemide 40 PO BID.
   - monitor fluid status
   - Continue furosemide
   # Hemoperitoneum: [**Month (only) 8**] be related to lupus serositis with concomitant
   Argatroban.  This was changed to heparin after PF4 antibody negative
   and patient tolerating with stable hematocrit.
   - Monitor daily hematocrit
   - active T+C
   - consider further studies to find source of bleeding if hct drops
   again
   - will stop heparin at sign of bleeding
   # Thrombocytopenia: most likely associated with her lupus. PF4
   antibodies negative.  Now on IVIG, day 3 in an attempt to achieve
   sustained platelet elevation.
   -IVIG
 plan for 6 days of treatment on [**2185-12-15**]
   # Seizure/Strokes: Likely [**12-19**] thromboembolic stroke in right
   parietal-temporal-occipital lobes as seen on MRI of brain, which is
   consistent with the clinical presentation (visual hallucinations). Also
   concern for lupus cerebritis. Much less liikely is meningitis given
   immunosuppression.   EEG without epileptiform acitivity.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations
   - heparin gtt started [**12-12**] for bridge to warfarin.  Will need to ask
   neurology for duration of anticoagulation.
   - f/u hypercoag panel
   - continue levetiracetam, level pending
   - lorazepam prn seizures
   - hold off on LP unless clinical course deteriorates
   # Recent infections:  Treated for Morganella in pleural fluid,
   citrobacter/bacteroides from blood cultures initially treated with
   ciprofloxacin/metronidazole, changed to pip/tazo for seizure risk, and
   completed course on [**2185-12-11**].  Received 10 days of ciprofloxacin which
   is sufficient course for positive Mycoplasma serology.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u G6PD before starting abx ppx (dapsone)
   - f/u ID regarding PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**]
   # Chronic renal failure: Due to SLE, with renal biopsy showing grade
   [**2-19**] membranoproliferative and membanous nephropathy. Also,
   hydronephrosis (right) on imaging with no clear sign of obstruction,
   likely [**12-19**] intraabdominal bleed compressing the ureter.
   - continue phos binders
   - discontinue sodium bicarbonate, no longer needed.
   - renally dose meds, follow Cre daily
   - appreciate renal recs (will likely need to be on cellcept at some
   point)
   #Hydronephrosis: US showing stable/improving hydronephrosis, creatinine
   stable.
   -urology recs- pt refusing foley for now.
   - Repeat renal ultraousound on [**2185-12-14**]

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement, afebrile for
   past four days.
   .
   # ARDS
 Patient has documented dead space of 84%. Patient had
   completed a course of treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with
   azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem. After worsening around
   [**12-20**], patient was started on vanc/zosyn. On [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] [**Female First Name (un) **] was done
   bilaterally for concern of empyema. Patient was trached on [**12-25**]. Patient
   continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
   Multiple bronchs have been done and there does not appear to be a
   current PNA since there are not any secretions. Concern for
   inflammatory causes less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or
   peripheral eosinophillia. Differential includes infectious cause vs.
   BOOP. There has been a poor response to antbiotics and no secretions on
   bronch argues against PNA. Patients peribronchovascular pattern could
   be consistent with BOOP over typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require
   treatment with steroids and until clear diagnosis is made difficult to
   justify steroids in the setting of possible infectious cause.
   Differentiation of the etiologies of the ARDS would require tissue bx.
   This would require VATS but the patient does not have enough lung
   reserve to take down one lung for the procedure. The patient
s clinical
   resp pattern is consistent with pulmonary fibrosis vs. rind. IP did not
   feel thoracentesis would be beneficial. Patient got PSV valve placed on
   [**12-30**], resp status improving.
   - Continue periods of PMV, trach mask and PSV 5/5, avoiding resp
   fatigue
   - patient would not be a good candidate for vasodialtors such as
   slidenafil or NO
   - will not tx with steroids
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 WBC stable, unclear etiology for patient's
   fever and leukocytosis.  Blood cultures NTD, VRE in urine but not
   likely source of infection. Cardiac echo, no evidence of endocarditis.
   No evidence of empyemas on [**Female First Name (un) **], pan-scan negative. Stopped Flagyl for
   cdiff b/c not consistent with lab or clinical findings.  Bilateral
   thoracentesis with no infectious organism identified.  Derm bx was
   consistent with fungal infection and their recs were to give a week of
   Fluconazole.  Will consider PO vanc if spikes a fever.
   - ID following, negative c diff
   - 7-day course of linezolid finished [**1-1**], fluconazole ends [**1-3**] for
   cutaneous candidiasis
   - follow-up cultures, no obvious source yet
   - foley changed [**1-1**]
   .
   # Met alkalosis
 likely combination of compensation for respiratory
   acidosis and contraction alkalosis
   -          will check VBG and give diamox depending on CO2/HCO3 level
   .
   #  Anemia
 stable
   -          received one unit PRBC yesterday, appropriately increased
   HCT to 31.6
   -          limit tx [**12-21**] concern for fluid overload
   .
   # Depression
 followed by  (outpt psych)
   - prozac dose to 80 mg daily
   - Continue Geodon
   - Intermittent Ativan
   .
   # Rash: Pt with papular rash and occasional pustules on lower back,
   buttocks
 location, symptoms do not appear c/w drug reaction.  Likely
   contact dermatitis or fungal infection.
   - c/w cutaneous candidiasis -> tx with fluconazole, last day [**1-3**]
   # FEN: getting tube feeds, replete lytes PRN, patient has severe
   cachexia
   -          nutrition recs increasing TFs by 5cc/hr (do not want to
   increase CO2 production too much given baseline tachypnea)
   -          Speech consult will do swallow eval when tolerating PSV 5/5
   with PMV for longer periods

   Microbiology: Sputum with E. coli
   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.  On
   vanc/zosyn/flagyl.
   # Shock:  Likely due to sepsis/hemorrhagic pancreatitis.    BP now
   stable.  Persistent fevers likely due to severe pancreatitis, not
   ongoing infectious source
   - Continue IVF (LR) prn
 follow CVP/HR
   - Continue vanc/zosyn and follow up cultures
   - Would add fungal coverage if dramatically worsens.
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Now growing E. coli sensitive
   to Zosyn out of sputum with persistent thick secretions, although main
   cause of resp failure likely volume overload/pulmonary edema.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**]
 wean FiO2
   as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for e.coli aspiration PNA
   - Continue on AC today as has significant secretions and no thoughts to
   extubate at this time.
   - Run TBB even today, but consider diuresis  tomorrow if BP allows.
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CT with evidence of severe
   necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   - T bili increased
 send direct/indirect and follow
   # FEN:
   - Post-pyloric Dophoff with TF (okay by surgery/ERCP).

   Pt just underwent bronchoscopy and is NPO for OR later today.  She will
   be intubated in OR and likely ([**Name8 (MD) 77**] MD) to be intubated for >24 hours.
   Inappropriate for PO evaluation at this time.  Please reconsult when pt
   is extubated and stable for >24 hours.  Pt should be able to tolerate
   periods on shovel mask or nasal cannula to promote PO intake.  She
   should also be awake/alert for periods of at least 15-30 minutes at a
   time for PO intake.  Pending bedside swallow evaluation, MD team
   encouraged to pursue alternative means of nutrition/hydration and
   medication (e.g., OGT/NGT vs. Dobbhoff vs. TPN).  Q4 oral care while

   he was walking in a park w/ his wife. It was his \"familiar\" CP. It went
   away by itself but came back again. He called 911 and went to OSH when
   he was still having the CP. There his EKG was normal and his first set
   of enzymes showed trop I 0.00 (nl <0.08) at 1817 on [**4-16**] (no CK
   available). He was started on IV heparin and IV nitro. He also received
   IV morphine. he was CP free by 8 pm. his second set of enzymes showed
   trop I 0.486 (nl <0.034) and CK 184 (nl <170)at 0430 on [**4-17**]. repeat
   EKG again   showed NSR and no sig ST-T changes from previous. He was
   xferred here for further mgmt.
   .
   In the CCU he denies CP, SOB. The CP did not recur since last night.
   .
   On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
   pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
   pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. he denies recent
   fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
   All of the other review of systems were negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea
   on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
   palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

   Imaging: ETT performed on [**3-30**] demonstrated:
   1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
   2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global
   left ventricular hypokinesis. Basal inferior hypokinesis is present.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess but
   is probably mildly depressed.
   3. In comparison to the previous report of [**2164-12-12**], there is probably
   no significant change.
   .
   CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2172-6-5**] demonstrated:
    1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with
   one vessel disease. The LMCA was angiographically without disease. The
   LAD wrapped around the apex without flow limiting stenoses. The stent
   in the LAD was widely patent. The LCX was without flow limiting
   stenoses with widely patent stent. The RCA had a mid 50% and a distal
   50% stenosis. There was a slow flow pattern in the distal RCA secondary
   to the dilation of the stented segment.
   2. Limited resting hemodynamics showed an elevated central aortic
   pressure (AO mean 104 mmHg).
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Mildly elevated central aortic pressure.
   .
   Previous cath
   -[**2168-4-19**]--no stents placed. LAD and LCx, RCA stents patent.
   -[**2167-10-12**]--Successful stenting of the mid LAD
   -[**4-/2163**]--no stents placed. Very mild RCA disease. prior stents in the OM1
   and mid RCA are widely patent
   --[**10/2162**]--The Cx and RCA were widely patent at the previously stented
   sites
   --[**9-/2162**]--Successful stenting of the proximal and mid circumflex
   --[**2162-7-19**]--Stenting was successfully performed on the proximal and mid
   RCA.
   ECG: EKG demonstrated NSR with no significant ST-T changes.

   inhibitor.
   --discontinue IV heparin
   --attempt to wean IV nitro throughout the day
   --received Plavix 300 x 1, will continue daily plavix 75mg
   --cont ASA, toprol XL, pravastatin, ACEI
   --cardiac enzymes, CK 147 Trop 0.25 last night, will trend
   --will likely have stress test tomorrow, if has CP will get cath
   tomorrow
   --PT consult today
   --Consider standing long acting nitrates, isordil 10mg TID, for angina
   symptoms
   #. dCHF: Looks euvolemic on exam. Last echo in 02 showed EF of 45-55%
   --cont ACEI
   #. H/o DVT:
   --hold coumadin for now if needs

   48 yo woman with congenital deafness and mental retardation, admitted
   to OSH in early [**Month (only) 1646**] after hip fracture, s/p [**Month (only) 2609**] there. Postop course
   complicated by recurrent aspiration and persistent respiratory failure.
   OSH course also notable for presumed-barotrauma-related PTX and
   hemothorax s/p VATS and chest tubes on the right. Transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on
   [**8-25**] for trach/PEG. Underwent trach on [**8-28**] at the bedside, peg
   deferred due to large liver. Managed initially for ARDS and septic
   shock both of which have resolved. Now s/p lap PEG on [**9-13**] and stable
   on trach collar. Plan for dc to rehab once consistently tolerating tube
   feeds. Some ileus on [**9-14**] that we are watching now. To the floor on

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   28 yo indian male with complicated history- [**2131-5-4**] admission for
   severe necrotizing pancreatitis in the setting of heavy EtOH use. Hosp
   course complicated by seizure and PEA arrest and resultant hypoxic
   encephalopathy. Chronic resp failure s/p trach in [**2131-6-4**]. Prior
   acute pancreatitis w/ pseudocyst formation. Was re-admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from
   rehab in early [**Month (only) 280**] for recurrent seizure activity. Also found to have
   SMV thrombosis in early [**Month (only) 280**]- on heparin gtt. Transferred to the ICU on
   [**7-20**] for a second PEA arrest, presumably due to mucus plug and
   hypoxemia. Initially in ICU course with persistent seizure activity-
   now resolved on Dilantin + Keppra + Ativan. Being covered w/ tobramycin
   and cetazidime (stopped cipro based on recent sensis) for Pseudomonas
   in sputum and in urine.  Mental status is currently withdrawing to
   noxious stimuli, not following commands, moving all 4 but
   nonpurposeful.  Defervescing on ABX regimen. Seized on the night of
   [**7-31**], responded to more Ativan, got re-loaded with Dilantin on [**8-1**].
   Plan is to return to rehab, looks like early next week is reasonable.
   Major issue is one of coughing fits every time he is on trach collar.
   Tolerates PSV 5/5 [**Last Name **] problem. Bronch'd earlier this week with nothing
   in the airways and well-positioned trach w/ minimal tracheal
   irritation. Not sure why this is happening though I suspect some local
   irritation- it is resolved w/ topical lidocaine though we are trying to
   minimize this due to seizure risk.
   24 Hour Events:
   Tolerating TM, but with intermittent coughing from secretions.

   EEG ([**6-15**]):
   IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow background and due to
   the bursts of frequent mixed frequency generalized slowing, some with
   very sharp features and with occasional bursts of an attenuation of the
   background in all areas. These findings indicate a widespread and
   mildly severe encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical
   structures. The rhythmic left temporal slowing associated with the
   patient's movements raise the possibility of a focal seizure (with
   spread), but these bursts were relatively brief. The recording does not
   establish definite diagnosis, and additional recording, preferably
   including times when the patient is not resting on her side, could be
   helpful with diagnosis.
   MRI ([**6-15**]): No territorial infarct or acute intracranial process. Small
   vessel ischemic disease and atrophy.

   # Acute MS changes: Improved since admission. Etiology unclear, though
   concerning for [**Name (NI) 8017**] toxicity given recent completion of chemo regimen
   with known neurotoxicity. Infection also likely contributing with
   fever, tachycardia and tachypnea.  CXR with possible RLL infiltrate.
   Hepatic encephalopathy unlikely given only mild elevation to LFTs. This
   is very unlikely to be meningitis acquired since admission to hospital,
   will hold off on LP for now and d/w neuro.
   - cont methylene blue and thiamine for [**Name (NI) 8017**] toxicity.

   Aspiration pneumonitis: Patient was originally covered for hospital
   witnessed aspiration event. Found to have a fever. No infiltrates have
   been visualized on CXR. No leukocytosis. AMS improved on current
   treatment.  Aspiration PNA unlikely.
   - Given negative culture data and no signs of infection, will D/C

   NSVT: Patient had run of 13 beats of Vtach in the setting of
   hypokalemia and hypomag.
   - replete lytes
   - monitor on tele
   # Hyperchloremic Non gap metabolic acidosis with hypokalemia: likely
   secondary to NS fluid resuscitation with chemotherapy treatment.
   - will continue to trend on AM/PM lytes
   - Continue LR @ 75 cc/hr

   # Follicular Cell Lymphoma: Pt with recurrent disease after initial
   treatment with RCHOP, she was admitted for induction with ICE+study
   [**Doctor Last Name **] in protocol regimen.  Pt was tolerating regimen well until today
   when she developped acute MS changes.  Now concern for [**Doctor Last Name 8017**]

   HPI:
   48 yo woman with congenital deafness and mental retardation, admitted
   to OSH in early [**Month (only) 1646**] after hip fracture, s/p [**Month (only) 2609**] there. Postop course
   complicated by recurrent aspiration and persistent respiratory failure.
   OSH course also notable for presumed-barotrauma-related PTX and
   hemothorax s/p VATS and chest tubes on the right. Transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on
   [**8-25**] for trach/PEG. Underwent trach on [**8-28**] at the bedside, peg
   deferred due to large liver. Managed initially for ARDS and septic
   shock both of which have resolved. Now s/p lap PEG on [**9-13**] and stable
   on trach collar. Plan for dc to rehab once consistently tolerating tube
   feeds. Some ileus on [**9-14**] that we are watching now. To the floor on

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   A 70 year-old man with a history of NSCLC s/p multiple resections
   complicated by broncopleural fistulas and endobronchial stent placement
   presents now for stent removal.
   .
   #  NSCLC s/p stent:  OSH physician feels that recurrent infections may
   be reduced by removal of stent.  He is now s/p multiple muscle flaps
   with the intention of fixing the fistulas.
   - plan for broncoscopy by IP today to investigate and possibly remove
   LUL stent.
   - CT after broncoscopy
   .
   # Chronic respiratory failure:  Patient remains intermittently vent
   dependent via tracheostomy since his last thoracotomy in [**7-29**].  He is
   currently on PCV  and appears comfortable on current settings.
   - continue ventilatory support at current settings.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC 14, up from 9 at the time of discharge.  Likely
   secondary to chronic fistula infections.
   - add-on differential
   - no abx for now
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Malnutrition:
   - resume glucerna at 65 cc/h after procedure
   .
   # history of PE:  not currently anticoagulated
   .
   # GERD:
   - continue pantoprazole
   .
   # Anxiety and pain:
   - continue lorazepam, morphine, haloperidol PRN
   .

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   A 67 yo woman with a history of very severe COPD on home O2 presents
   with pneumonia and COPD exacerbation requiring MICU admission.
   .
   #  Pneumonia:  Multilobar infiltrates on CXR.  Labs with significant
   leukocytosis and L shift, likely indicative of bacterial infection.
   Afebrile currently, although report of \"chills\" at home.  Current SBP
   95-105 is likely low for patient (SBP 120-150 in clinic notes)  and may
   be a signal of impending sepsis.  Regarding the pneumonia itself, given
   history of idiopathic RUL collapse in [**5-4**], it is possible that she
   has some sort of endobronchial lesion (? malignancy given smoking hx)
   contributing.  In any case, because of her very severe baseline
   obstructive disease, she is in a very tenuous respiratory place right
   now.
   - vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin for broad bacterial coverage
   including atypical pathogens.  (Lives in [**Hospital3 22**] facility,
   chronic respiratory disease so will treat as if HCAP.)
   - blood cx
   - sputum cx
   - urinary legionella antigen
   - IVF - will give 1 L NS bolus now and continuing with goal MAP >65,
   goal uop >35 cc/h.  Previous echo with NL EF.
   - repeat CXR in AM (will get PA/Lat for better visualization)
   - serial ABG (will not repeat overnight unless O2 Saturation falls)
   - trend WBC (will be complicated by steroids)
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] whether CT and/or bronchoscopy may be
   indicated for better visualization of possible endobronchial lesion
   that may be contributing to recurrent pathology in that lobe
   .
   #  COPD:  very severe COPD with FEV1 <30% predicted.  No history
   intubation.  Currently very tachypneic with poor air movement.
   - serial ABG as above
   - methylprednisolone 40 mg q8h (will hold off on 125mg given
   concominant infecitious picture)
   - fluticasone inh
   - albuterol nebs q1h for now, decrease to q6h as tolerated
   - ipratropium nebs q6h
   - may require intubation if tires
   .
   #  hx hypertension:  borderline hypotensive currently
   - hold all antihypertensives
   .
   # kidney injury:  unclear whether acute or chronic (no baseline labs,
   but no recorded history of renal insufficiency.)  She may be prerenal
   in the setting of lower than normal perfusion pressure
   -  check urine lytes
   -  trend creatinine
   -  avoid nephrotoxins
   .

   leg pain.  His furosemide dose was decreased on that admission and he
   began receiving weekly transfusions for his end-stage MDS.  Per his
   family, his bilateral lower extremity has progressively worsened over
   the last couple of weeks and the redness in his left lower leg has
   worsened significantly in the last three days ago
   .
   In the ED, initial vs were: BP 106/54, HR 72, R 30 O2 sat 86%.  Patient
   was felt to globally appear unwell.  Labs were notable for a WBC count
   of 37.2 and lactate of 3.3.  Chest x-ray was read as no acute process.
   Patient was given cefepime 2g IV, levofloxacin 750 mg IV, 500 cc NS, a
   six pack of platelets, and morphine 1 mg IV x 5.  He was ordered for
   blood but did not receive it prior to leaving the ED.  Vital signs on
   transfer were BP 91/55, HR 100, 98% on RA, RR 16.
   .sincse coming to icu pain control and aspiration issues have been the
   main focus.  Positive stool from earlier today is pos for c diff.   pt
   is on flagyl, levofloxicin and linazolid.  Per speech and swallow
   review today pt can not tol thin liquids.  Thickened fluid and soft
   foods
   Course in MSICU has been as follows:
   CV
s temp is 98.7 axillary.   BP stable but HR is between 90
   120
s AFib.   Restarted betablocker at lower dose than usual with no
   improvement in hr
   Resp
 rales at bases
 cl upper.   Strong cough but non productive.
   Pt was on RA most of the night but sat began dropping to low 90
s when
   asleep so O2 back on with NC at 2L.   No c/o SOB or difficulty
   breathing.
   GI
 Colostomy draining adequate amt loose brown stool.   Appliance
   changed x2 by personal care assisitant.   Abd soft with no discomfort.
   Tolerating ice chips and sips of water well when sitting up.   Wants to
   drink when more supine and appears to have more difficulty
   swallowing.
   GU
 Pt refuses to have a foley cath placed.   States he had a
   difficult placement with last admission and does not want another
   one.   He has been able to void via urinal x1 for approx 300cc dark
   amber urine.   Bladder does not feel distended at this point.
   Heme
 Pt received 6units platelets in ED and 2 units PRBC
s in
   MSICU.   Hct increased 3 pts and pltlets up to 33 from 29 after
   transfusion.
   ID
 pt receiving flagyl and daptomycin IV and levoflaxacin PO for
   coverage.   Stool spec sent but pt still needs a urine and sputum spec.
   Neuro
 Pt waxes and wanes with level of alertness.   At times he is
   very pleasant and cooperative and appears to understand where he is and
   why.   Other times he is belligerent and shouting out and demanding.
   Does not understand he cannot get out of bed to go to the BR.   He is
   unable to move either of his legs on command
 do not know if this is
   physical or due to pain.
   Extremities
 lower extremities continue to be very edematous and
   tender.   Leg leg with erythema area that does not appear to be
   increasing in size.  Both legs extremely tender to touch and pt
   receiving MSO4 IV push for pain with fair to good response.
   Pt has a difficult time getting comfortable and is not able to express
   what will help him.
   Social
 Very involved family
 wife and 5 children.   Wife and
   daughter are HCP.  Daughter is a NP on [**Location (un) 1339**] and appears to be
   the most involved in his care.   Wife is very appropriate and appears
   to understand his POC.   She went home last evening to rest.   Pt
   personal care asst has been at

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated after patient presents self cooled and in coma. On [**1-2**] became
   bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT arrest. Received a
   tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to partially in the RA
   causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Weaned pressors now only on phenylephrine. Improved mental status.
   Trach placed. Now s/p PCI with stent to left main, jailed LAD with
   balloon espansion with good flow.
   #. Coronary Artery Disease:
   Patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest.   s/p PCI
   [**1-17**] of LMCA. On Intra-aortic balloon pump s/p PCI.
   - continue plavix
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   - continue low dose beta blocker with pressor on for blood pressure
   support
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential.
   - hold lasix today.
   - giving one dose acetazolamide in addition in setting of metabolic
   alkalosis
   - trach stitches can be removed [**1-19**]
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis:
   pH trending upwards on blood gases overnight.  Need to be careful of
   further contraction alkalosis with diuresing further with lasix in the
   setting of metabolic alkalosis.   Consider RTA type 4 which could also
   account for possible potassium wasting.  AM cortisol  yesterday was
   within normal limits.
   - acetazolamide prn
   #. Fever: Patient appeared to respond well to meropenem but has
   received full course antibiotics.  Unclear what source of distributive
   shock is, may not be infectious.  AM cortisol within normal limits.
   WBC stable.  Spiked another temperature this AM.
   - follow up cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan, low suspicion
   - pan culture.
   - re-site central line.
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Has been recurrent and intermittent.  Had no further episodes over
   atrial fibrillation overnight.  Has been Amiodarone IV loaded in the
   past.
   - cont telemetry
   - continue low dose beta blocker
   #. Pancreatitis:
   Lipase was elevated although now appears resolved. No longer needing
   fentanyl boluses for pain control. TG normal. Abdominal ultrasound
   shows no evidence of stones. GI consulted.  Exam is benign.
   - apparently resolved.
   #Acute Kidney injury:
   Patient
s creatinine is now at 1.3 trending down from peak of 2.
   Presented w Cr 1.0 on admission. Making good urine to PO lasix.
   Received mucomyst x5 doses prior to Cath.  Hypokalemia does not just
   appear to be associated with diuresis; consider potassium loss through
   kidneys.
   - replete lytes PRN
   - continue to monitor post Cath ; risk of contrast-induced nephropathy
   starting up to 48 hours later
   #. Anemia:
   CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandem heart, which
   appeared associated with anemia, has been removed.  unclear etiology,
   but will transfuse as needed.  Old blood suctioned out of trach tube
   persistently but not as much as before, no active bleed.  Hct stable
   for now.  Guiaic positive today.
   -          transfuse as needed.
   -          Pm hematocrit.
   #. Neurologic status:
   Patient is now very responsive and participatory, moves toes and arms
   well, turns head and tries to speak.  CT head shows no evidence of
   stroke.
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition:
   - continue tube feeds.
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx
 no acute bleeding, has old clots
   - bronch clear of blood.
   # Hyperglycemia:
   No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on hydrocortisone w
   study protocol.  Study drug now stopped.  Remains hyperglycemic however
   over past several days.
   - ISS
    # Goals of care
 patient now back to full code.

   nausea after having her lopressor increased and diltiazem added several
   weeks ago for AF. She has had poor po intake, decreased UOP since
   discharge [**12-10**]. On admission, O2 sat 80%, INR 9.7, Cr 2.6 (from 1.4),
   CXR clear. She has been given ~ 4L IVF over course of the day. O2
   pleths have been unreliable throughout day although blood gas earlier
   in day with PaO2 of 133. This evening, repeat ABG performed due to
   persistently poor pleth revealed PaO2 41 with lactate 4. She was placed
   on NRB and transferred to CCU. Currently, she denies any current SOB.
   She notes her breathing feels much better than on admission. She denies
   any SOB at rest. No current CP, LH. Lengthy discussion held with
   patient regarding escalation of care with intubation and resuscitation
   if necessary and she was clear that she would not want CPR, electric
   shocks, or intubation.

   Labs reviewed. Repeat ABG in ICU on NRB with PaO2 60. Lactate improved
   to 3. INR 10.8. Cr worsened again:  2.6->1.6->1.4. CXR without frank
   pulmonary edema. ECG AF with V rate 42. Diffuse low voltage. Nl axis.
   Diffuse TW flattening. Compared to prior [**2141-12-19**], HR is slower.
   A/P: 87 yoF w/ R heart failure, severe TR, severe pulmonary htn, PAF
   admitted with presyncope and nausea in the setting of uptitration of
   nodal agents and poor po intake now with unexplained hypoxia,
   hypotension, bradycardia, ARF, and supratherapeutic INR.
   Regarding her hypoxia, the cause is unclear. Worsened since admission.
   Main intervention has been IVF expansion but little evidence to suggest
   pulmonary edema. Suspect some contribution of severe pulmonary
   hypertension although would not explain acute worsening. Possibly
   related to R->L shunting from increased R sided filling pressures with
   volume expansion.
   Regarding her hypotension, bradycardia, and ARF, all presumed due to
   decreased po intake and increase in nodal agents 2 weeks ago. BPs
   improved after 4L IVF. HRs remains slow but presyncopal symptoms have
   improved. Unclear why Cr so variable during admission. Rare urine eos
   seen and urine Na 62 so may not be entirely prerenal in etiology.
   Patient does not want escalation of care. Wishes made clear that she is
   DNR/DNI. Good insight into her situation. Could consider trial of BiPAP
   but might worsen left sided filling given RV failure, TR, and pulm htn
   and unclear if will improve oxygenation dramatically w/o e/o pulm edema
   or underlying COPD.
   - cont high flow O2
   - consider trial of vasopressors to increase left sided afterload to
   see if improves oxygenation which would support diagnosis of R->L
   shunting
   - cont to hold BP meds and nodal agents
   - hold coumadin until INR<3

 FINDINGS: ETT has been pulled back since the study of [**2149-2-16**]. The NG tube tip
 appears unchanged and projects over the gastric bubble. The lungs are slightly
 better aerated in the lower lobes. However, the atelectatic opacities seen at
 both upper lobes (right greater) are not significantly changed or even
 somewhat worsened. The left sided PICC catheter tip is unchanged. The
 cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits. The bowel gas pattern is
 non-obstructed.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATIONS:  Decreased oxygen saturation.  CHF.

 COMPARISONS:  [**2166-1-17**].

 An ICD remains in place with right atrial and right ventricular leads.  The
 heart demonstrates left ventricular configuration and is mildly enlarged.
 There remains upper zone vascular redistribution and perihilar haziness, as
 well as areas of patchy increased opacity in the right perihilar region and in
 both lower lobes.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions present, with
 the left effusion apparently new in the interval and the right effusion not
 significantly changed.  A left PICC line has been removed in the interval and
 replaced with a right PICC line, which terminates in the superior vena cava.

 IMPRESSION:
 1) Persistent findings suggestive of CHF.  Additional multifocal patchy lung
 opacities in the right perihilar region, and in both lung bases likely reflect
 asymmetric edema, although underlying infection is also possible in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 2) Small left pleural effusion, new in the interval.  No significant changes
 of small right pleural effusion.

 CT OF ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:

 COMPARISON:  [**2163-7-16**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous serial axial images were obtained from the lung bases
 to the pubic symphysis after administration of oral contrast.  IV contrast was
 not administered.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases are clear.
 There is stable prominence of the common bile duct.  The liver, gallbladder,
 pancreas, spleen and adrenals are otherwise grossly unremarkable.  The kidneys
 are atrophic bilaterally.  There are extensive dense vascular calcifications.
 There are tiny mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes that do not meet CT
 requirement for pathologic enlargement.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The uterus, bladder, rectum, and
 interpelvic loops of bowel are grossly unremarkable. The previously identified
 fluid collection within the right lower quadrant has resolved.  There is
 residual soft tissue density remaining consistent with scarring and/or
 inflammatory change.  The cervix appears prominent.  Direct visualization is
 suggested for further characterization.  There are small, right greater than
 left, inguinal lymph nodes.  The largest is on the right and measures 1.0 x
 1.7 cm.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Osseous structures demonstrate degenerative changes but are
 otherwise unremarkable.

 INDICATION:  42 y/o female with necrotizing pancreatitis and a PICC line is
 needed for TPN and IV medication.

 PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27**],
 attending radiologist, being present and supervising the procedure.  The right
 upper arm was prepped in sterile fashion.  Since no suitable superficial veins
 were visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a suitable vein. The
 basilic vein was patent and compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 ml 1%
 Lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under son[**Name (NI) 64**] guidance with a 21
 gauge needle.  A 0.018 guide wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the
 superior vena cava.  Based on the markers on the guide wire it was determined
 that a length of 37 cm would be suitable. The Vaxcel double lumen PICC line
 was trimmed to the length and advanced through a 4 FR introducer sheath under
 fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava. The sheath was removed. The
 catheter was flushed.  A final chest X-ray was obtained.  The film
 demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava just above the atrium.
 The line is ready for use.

 A stat lock was applied and the line was hep-locked.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 37 cm total length 4 FR double lumen
 PICC line with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

 CT OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAS:

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous serial axial images are obtained from the lung apices
 through the symphysis pubis after the administration of 150 cc of non ionic
 optiray contrast.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are
 present.  The nasogastric tube terminates within the gastric fundus.  There is
 no axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  The heart and great vessels are
 grossly unremarkable.  The lung windows reveal a patchy parenchymal opacity at
 the posterior aspect of the right upper lobe.  Smaller adjacent and subpleural
 ill-defined parenchymal opacities are also present.   These changes are likely
 infectious/inflammatory.  There is bilateral dependent atelectasis.
  There is no effusion.  There is a small right apical bulla.

 BONE WINDOWS:  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenals and kidneys
 are grossly unremarkable.  There is non specific bilateral, left greater than
 right perinephric stranding.  The ureters are normal in caliber.  There is no
 hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.  There are tiny non specific mesenteric and
 retroperitoneal lymph nodes that do not meet CT requirement for pathologic
 enlargement.  Intraabdominal loops of bowel are grossly unremarkable.  There
 is no ascites or free intraperitoneal gas.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Numerous surgical clips are present
 consistent with prior prostatectomy.  There is no evidence of local
 recurrence.  A Foley catheter is present within the bladder.  There is a small
 approximately 6 mm, suprapubic lymph node. There are tiny bilateral inguinal
 lymph nodes that do not meet CT requirement for pathologic enlargement.
 Intrapelvic loops of bowel are grossly unremarkable.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Osseous structures reveal degenerative changes involving both
 hips.  There is a linear lucency within the right femoral neck suggesting
 prior instrumentation.

 INDICATION:  Back pain. Assess for aortic dissection.

 COMPARISONS:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Pre and post contrast CT of the chest and abdomen, dissection
 protocol.

 CONTRAST:  150 cc Optiray secondary to fast rate of bolus injection.

 MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS:  The multiplanar reformats confirm the findings
 described below.

 AORTIC CT ANGIOGRAM:  There is extensive aortic dissection detected but
 preferential filling of the true lumen.  The intimal flap extends from the
 root of the aorta through the arch and extending distally to the iliac
 bifurcation. There is compromise of the origin of the left common carotid
 artery. The dissection also extends up the right brachiocephalic artery. The
 origins are all from the true lumen.  The origin of the right common carotid
 artery is also compromised.  Splanchnic flow appears well preserved, though
 the origin of the celiac is narrowed and involved. The kidneys demonstrate
 subtle difference in degree of cortical enhancement and on this single phase
 study, the left is slightly delayed.

 There is a small pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions.
 The lungs demonstrate patchy ground glass opacities at the bases bilaterally,
 right greater then left, likely representing fluid.  The liver, gallbladder,
 spleen, adrenal glands and pancreas are unremarkable. The bowel is
 unremarkable in appearance, though unopacified.  There is no free air or free
 fluid in the abdomen. There is no lymphadenopathy.  The osseous structures
 demonstrate multilevel degenerative changes.

 IMPRESSION: Aortic dissection extending from the root through the bifurcation
 with compromise of the origins of the bilateral carotid arteries as well as
 involvement of the brachiocephalic artery and celiac trunk.  Differential
 renal perfusion is perceived, with delayed cortical enhancement on the left.

 INDICATION: Bright red blood per rectum, 16 units transfused already, 2
 negative nuclear medicine scans, noncontributory lower endoscopy, negative
 upper endoscopy, s/p partial colectomy (unknown extent and location).

 RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 5788**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5789**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 737**] [**Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name 325**]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
 [**Name (STitle) 325**], the staff radiologist, was present during the entire exam.

 PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure. Intravenous
 sedation was performed the ICU team, who had recently placed an endotracheal
 tube. 1% Lidocaine for local anesthesia. 205 cc of Optiray 320 were used
 intraarterially.
 The left groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19 gauge
 needle was introduced in the left common femoral artery and an 0.035 guidewire
 was advanced to the aorta under fluoroscopy. The needle was removed and a 5
 French sheath was placed over the wire. The sidearm of the sheath was
 connected to continuous irrigation with heparinized saline. A 4 French
 OmniFlush catheter was advanced to the aorta and a global aortogram was
 performed.
 An 0.035 Glidewire was advanced to the aorta with a Cobra C2 catheter, and a
 selective catheterization of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was
 performed. Several selective SMA arteriograms were obtained.
 The OmniFlush catheter was placed in the distal aorta over a wire and a pelvic
 aortogram was performed.
 A glidewire was again placed and the Omniflush catheter was exchanged for the
 Cobra C2 catheter. Selective catheterization of the celiac trunk and splenic
 artery was performed. An arteriogram was obtained. The catheter was removed.
 The findings were discussed with the Surgical Team during the examination and
 the patient was then transferred to the Operating Room. In agreement with the
 Surgical Team, the left femoral arterial sheath was left in place and sutured
 to the skin with 0-Prolene. The sheath will be used as an arterial line.

 FINDINGS: Aortogram demonstrates the celiac, superior mesenteric and renal
 arteries are patent. The inferior mesenteric artery is not visualized. There
 is ectasia of the infrarenal aorta.
 There is occlusion of the proximal right common iliac artery with delayed
 retrograde filling of the right internal iliac artery from multiple pelvic
 collaterals. This retrograde flow in the right hypogastric artery then refills
 antegradely the right external iliac artery.
 There is a web-like stenosis at the ostium of the left common iliac artery, as
 well as a small pseudoaneurysm located just above. The bilateral external and

 SELECTIVE ARTERIOGRAM OF THE SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY: The superior
 mesenteric artery is patent, there is no evidence of active extravasation,
 hypervascular mass, nor early venous filling. The portal vein appears patent
 on delayed images. During superior mesenteric artery arteriogram, there was
 retrograde opacification of the gastroduodenal artery refilling the celiac
 arterial system up to its origin. This was highly suggestive of a severe
 ostial narrowing of the celiac trunk.

 CELIAC ARTERIOGRAM: A 3 French catheter was advanced with difficulty over a
 glidewire through the ostium of the celiac trunk until its tip reached the
 splenic artery, confirming the suspicion of severe ostial stenosis of the
 celiac artery. Previous attempts with a 4 French catheter were unsuccessful.
 The celiac arteriogram demonstrates no evidence of active bleeding.

 The pelvic aortogram demonstrated occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Global aortogram and selective arteriograms of the celiac artery and
 superior mesenteric artery do not show active bleeding or source lesion. The
 [**Female First Name (un) **] is occluded.
 2. Occlusion of the right common iliac artery and complex lesion (stenosis and
 pseduoaneurysm) at the aortic bifurcation. Ectasia of the infrarenal aorta.

 The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 56387**] and the Surgical team at the time of
 the exam.

 INDICATIONS:  Spiking fevers, post-op day 7 after abdominal operation.

 No prior studies are available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired helically
 from the lung bases through the pubic symphysis with 150 cc of Optiray
 contrast.  There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.

 FINDINGS:  Atelectasis is seen within the dependent portions of both lung
 bases.  No focal liver lesions are identified.  The spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, and intraabdominal loops of small bowel are unremarkable.  The stomach
 contains an NG tube.  Numerous surgical clips are present throughout the
 abdomen.  There is a small collection of non-organized fluid adjacent to the
 inferior liver edge.  No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal
 nodes are seen.  A tiny likely simple cyst is present in the mid portion of
 the left kidney.  The kidneys otherwise enhance symmetrically without evidence
 of obstruction.  The small bowel loops are normal in caliber.  An ostomy is
 present in the right lower quadrant.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Arising immediately adjacent to the rectal
 suture line is a pocket of fluid which demonstrates an enhancing rim and
 contains internal air.  The pocket measures 3.6 x 7.0 cm. The air abuts the
 suture line. This fluid collection represents an abscess or a leak.  The
 distal ureters, bladder, and remaining rectum are unremarkable.  No
 pathologically- enlarged pelvic or inguinal nodes are seen.

 No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are identified.  Diffuse
 degenerative changes are seen in the spine.

 IMPRESSION:  Fluid collection with enhancing rim and containing internal air,
 representing a leak or abscess.

 These results were discussed with the surgical housestaff at the time of
 interpretation.

   60 year old man with ESRD, HD dependent, and cirrhosis, admitted for VATS
  decortication of left lung effusion, now with HD catheter with poor flows.
 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  please place new permacath due to poor blood flow with current catheter . pt is

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT

 This is a 60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease. Hemodialysis
 dependent, cirrhosis admitted for VATS decortication of left lung effusion now
 with poor flow in the previously placed hemodialysis catheter.

 After the patient was imaged under fluoroscopy it was determined that the kink
 in the previously placed catheter from the right internal jugular vein was
 inserted too high in the neck thereby creating an acute bend in the catheter
 which kinked. The kink is the reason for poor flow and because of this the
 catheter was removed. A new internal jugular puncture was made under
 ultrasound control approximately 2 cm above the right clavicle. The new tunnel
 was made lateral to the previous  tunnel site.  T he new Angiodynamics
 catheter (23 cm tip to cuff) was tunneled to the internal jugular puncture
 site. The  guidewire and microcatheter in the jugular vein  was exchanged for
 an .038 wire and the soft tissue tract into the jugular vein was dilated to a
 9 F size followed by placement of the peel- away sheath. The guide wire and
 internal stylete was removed from the peel-away sheath and the tunnel dialysis
 catheter placed in the right atrium. The long tip of the dialysis catheter was
 placed in the right atrium with the short limb at the junction of the right
 atrium and superior vena cava. There was excellent flow. Single stitch was
 placed in the region of the jugular puncture and the dialysis catheter sutured
 to maintain placement.

 CONCLUSION:
 1. Removal of previously placed dialysis catheter because of  inadequate
 function.
 2. Replacement with a new catheter satisfactory for immediate dialysis.

 INDICATIONS: Elevated white count and changes in neurologic exam, please
 evalute for infectious source.

 TECHNIQUE: Head CT without and with IV contrast.

 FINDINGS: CT with and without IV contrast: There are no prior comparable
 examinations available for comparison.

 Two peripheral, well circumscribed, calcified lesions are present located
 within the right frontal and right parietal area.  The right frontal lesion
 measures 9.7 mm in greatest diameter and demonstrates heterogeneous
 calcification internally.  The right parietal lesion measures 11.6 mm in
 greatest diameter, with internal calcification and with post contrast
 enhancement.  There is no hemorrhage or edema detected around these lesions.
 There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.

 Within the right cerebellum is a focal area of hypodensity in the superior
 portion of the right cerebellar hemisphere consistent with old infarction. The
 density values of the brain parenchyma are otherwise within normal limits.
  The remainder of the surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 1. Two peripheral, dural based lesions in right frontal and right parietal
 location, with the parietal lesion demonstrating a focus of enhancement.  The
 appearance of these lesions is most consistent with meningioma, although the
 differential diagnosis includes calcified granulomas.
 2. Area of chronic infarction in the superior portion of the right cerebellar
 hemisphere.

 These findings communicated to the clinical team at the time of
 interpretation.

 CT OF THE TORSO:

 INDICATION:  Elevated amylase and WBC post cardiac surgery.

 TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast and portal venous phase images were obtained through
 the abdomen.  Delayed images were obtained through the chest, abdomen and
 pelvis.

 CONTRAST:  100 cc of Optiray were administered without complication.  Nonionic
 contrast was provided given the patient's generalized debility.

 CT CHEST AFTER IV CONTRAST:  The patient is post median sternotomy.  There are
 prosthetic aortic and mitral valves.  A PA catheter placed via the right IJ
 terminates in the right main pulmonary artery.  Multiple epicardial pacing
 leads are seen.  There are bilateral chest tubes.  The right-sided chest tube
 enters anteriorly through the pericardial fat and travels laterally to
 terminate in the right lung base.  The left-sided chest tube also enters
 anteriorly and terminates laterally within the left mid lung zone.  There is
 cardiomegaly with left atrial enlargement.  There is a moderate amount of
 pericardial fluid.  In the right anterior superior mediastinum, at the level
 of the pulmonary artery bifurcation, there is a 3 X 2.5 cm area of
 heterogeneous density with increased attenuation in its periphery.  There is
 bibasilar atelectasis.   A small left-sided posterior pleural effusion is
 loculated.  There are small bilateral pneumothoraces.  There is subcutaneous
 emphysema at the site of the right-sided chest tube.

 CT ABDOMEN BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST:  There is a small amount of ascites
 surrounding the liver and spleen with a more moderate amount of fluid seen
 in the pelvis.  There is a single dense gallstone but the gallbladder is
 nondistended and the wall is not thickened.  A small amount of stranding is
 seen within the root of the mesentery and there is a small amount of ascites
 at the tail of the pancreas.  However, the pancreas enhances homogeneously and
 does not appear enlarged.  There are no enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal
 lymph nodes.  Contrast is seen through to the splenic flexure and there are no
 areas of bowel thickening or luminal dilatation.  The mesenteric vessels are
 patent.  Incidental note is made of a calcified nonenhancing splenic artery
 aneurysm (series 4, image 53, 13 X 16 mm).

 CT PELVIS AFTER IV CONTRAST:  There is a moderate amount of free fluid within

 VIEWS:  Single AP portable semiupright view, comparison dated [**2132-8-13**].

 FINDINGS:  There is stable cardiomegaly and mediastinal contour, with improved
 appearance of bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion.  Persistent and stable
 left retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm.  There has been
 interval improvement in linear opacities at the right base, with improved
 definition of the right hemidiaphragm.  No pneumothorax.  The left main stem
 bronchus appears somewhat horizontal, probably secondary to left atrial
 enlargement.  The visualized osseous structures are unchanged.  The
 tracheostomy tube remains in stable position.  Prior CABG.

 IMPRESSION:  1)  Improving congestive heart failure.
 2)  Improved linear opacities at right base suggests improving atelectasis
 versus inflammation.
 3)  Stable left lower lobe collapse versus consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  48 y/o man status post proximal left subclavian artery stent
 presents with suspected stent thrombosis.

 COMPARISONS:  None.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were acquired through the base of the neck
 and upper thorax at 5 mm intervals before the administration of IV contrast.
 Then contiguous axial images were acquired through the base of the neck and
 the left upper hemithorax at 1.25 mm intervals after the uneventful
 administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast intravenously. Images were
 acquired at 20 second and 40 second delays after rapid bolus injection.

 Delayed images through the chest were acquired at 5 mm intervals.

 NECK AND LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY CTA:  CT angiogram of the neck and left upper
 thorax demonstrates a stent at the proximal left subclavian artery, extending
 approximately 1.5 cm into the left subclavian artery distally to approximately
 0.5 cm prior to the outflow of the left vertebral artery.  The stent is widely
 patent.  There is no evidence of thrombus formation within it.

 The aortic arch anatomy is normal.  The proximal brachiocephalic artery, right
 and left vertebral arteries, right and left common carotid  and left
 subclavian artery are all patent.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of pathologic axillary
 lymphadenopathy. The anterior mediastinum is normal.  A small benign
 prevascular lymph node is seen.  A precarinal lymph node is seen  measuring
 approximately 2.3 x 1.0 cm in diameter.  A small subcarinal lymph node is seen
 measuring 0.6 cm in diameter.  Lung windows demonstrate evidence of bilateral
 dependent atelectasis.  There are no lung nodules or masses.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.

 INDICATION:  57-year-old male with dysphagia S/P CABG.

 The radiologist was present to assist the speech pathologist in performance of
 a video oropharyngeal swallow examination.

 FINDINGS:  There is mild impairment of oral bolus control with straw sips of
 thin liquid.  Otherwise, the oral phase is normal.  In the pharyngeal phase of
 swallow, there is mild decreased bulus propulsion and valecular residue.
 Laryngeal elevation, epiglottic deflection and valve closure are normal.
 Minimal aspiration was identified with straw sips of thin liquid during
 swallowing , due to premature spill-over. There was no spontaneous cough, and
 cued cough was ineffective.  Treatment techniques including repeat swallows
 were effective.

 IMPRESSION:  Minimal aspiration straw sips of thin liquid, with ineffective
 spontaneous cough.  However, no otherwise significant impairment of the oral
 or pharyngeal phase of swallow.  Please see the speech pathology report in the
 OMR notes for further details and recommendations.

 MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient status post surgery for spinal abscess for
 follow-up.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 and T1 axial images
 of the thoracic spine were obtained before gadolinium.  T1 sagittal and axial
 images were obtained following gadolinium.  Comparison was made of the
 previous MRI study of [**2144-7-8**].

 FINDINGS:  Since the previous MRI study the patient has undergone extensive
 laminectomy extending from C4 to T6 level.  The previously seen collection
 posterior to the spinal cord in the upper thoracic and lower cervical region
 has been removed.  There is no new collection seen within the spinal canal in
 the thoracic region.  Extensive soft tissue changes are seen posteriorly
 secondary to surgical procedure.  An area of increased signal is identified
 within the spinal cord at C4 level indicating cord edema or myelomalacia which
 is unchanged from the previous study.

 The prevertebral soft tissues are well maintained.  There is no evidence of
 fluid collection seen in the prevertebral soft tissues in the cervical or
 thoracic region.  Mild multilevel degenerative changes are identified in the
 thoracic region.  In the cervical region degenerative changes are also noted
 as before.

 IMPRESSION:  Interval drainage of the abscess in the spinal canal.  No new
 collection identified.  Persistent increased signal within the spinal cord at
 C3 and C4 level as seen on the previous study.  No evidence of abnormal
 prevertebral soft tissue collection.  Extensive soft tissue changes at the
 laminectomy site and posterior to it secondary to recent surgery.  Bilateral
 changes of pleural effusion and lung atelectasis in the visualized thorax.

 CMR Technical Information:
 1) Structure: Axial dual-inversion T1-weighted images of the myocardium were
 obtained with and without spectral fat saturation pre-pulses.
 2) Function: Breath-hold cine SSFP images were acquired in the left
 ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, horizontal long axis, and contiguous short
 axis orientations. Tagged C-SPAMM cine images were also obtained in the 4-
 chamber orientation.
 3) Flow: Phase-contrast cine images were obtained transverse to the aorta
 (axial plane) and main pulmonary artery (oblique plane).
 4) Viability: Delayed enhancement (DE) images were obtained using a segmented
 inversion-recovery TFE acquisition. Short-axis, four chamber and two-chamber
 long-axis images were obtained 15 minutes after injection of a total of 0.2
 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine (29 ml Magnevist  solution) with and without
 spectral fat saturation pre-pulses.

 Findings:
 Structure and Function
 There was normal epicardial fat distribution. The myocardium appeared to have

                                 FINAL REPORT
 (Cont)
 homogenous signal intensity without evidence of myocardial fatty infiltration.
  The pericardium appeared normal in thickness.  There was a small left pleural
 effusion and no pericardial effusion. The origins of the left main and right
 coronary arteries were identified in their customary positions.  The LIMA to
 LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM and saphenous vein graft to PDA were
 identified and appeared patent (cannot exclude co-existent disease).  The
 diameter of the ascending, descending thoracic aorta and main pulmonary artery
 diameter were normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was normal.  The right and
 left atrial lengths in the 4-chamber view were mildly increased and normal,
 respectively.  The coronary sinus diameter was normal.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and end-diastolic volume indices
 were normal.  The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was normal at
 73% with normal regional and global systolic function.  The left ventricular
 mass was normal.  The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal.
  The calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 65%, with
 normal regional and global systolic function.  There was no focal thinning or
 fatty infiltration seen in the RV free wall.  There were no aneurysms seen in
 the RV free wall or right ventricular outflow tract.
 The pericardial thickness was normal without evidence of tethering on tagged
 images.
 Quantitative Flow
 There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt.  Aortic flow demonstrated no
 significant aortic regurgitation.  The calculated mitral valve regurgitant
 fraction was consistent with mild mitral regurgitation.   The resultant
 effective forward LVEF was normal at 67%. The right ventricular stroke volume
 and pulmonic flow demonstrated no significant pulmonic or tricuspid
 regurgitation.

 Viability
 There were no areas of focal hyperenhancement, consistent with the absence of
 myocardial scarring/infarction.

 Impression:
 1. Normal left ventricular cavity size with normal regional and global left
 ventricular systolic function.  The LVEF was normal at 73%.  The effective
 forward LVEF was normal at 67%.  No MR evidence of prior myocardial
 scarring/infarction.
 2. Patent LIMA to LAD, SVG-OM and SVG-PDA bypass grafts.
 3. Normal right ventricular cavity size and function. The RVEF was normal at
 65%. No MR evidence of right ventricular fatty infiltration/dysplasia.
 4. Mild mitral regurgitation.
 5. Mild right atrial dilation.

 The images were reviewed by [**Clip Number (Radiology) 4833**]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4837**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

 INDICATION: Left clavicle fracture.

 FINDINGS: Four images of the left shoulder and clavicle are provided,
 including internal and external rotation, axillary view and coned down view of
 the AP clavicle. In comparison to a portable chest x-ray of [**2171-7-12**], the
 distal left clavicular fracture has developed extensive surrounding callus.
 The distal clavicle remains angulated superiorly, consistent with
 coracoclavicular ligament injury. There is normal alignment of the proximal
 humerous with the glenoid fossa.

 Multiple partially visualized and healing posterolateral rib fractures involve
 the upper left hemithorax. The peripheral left upper lung field appears clear.

 IMPRESSION: Healing rib fractures. Extensive callus surrounding superiorly
 displaced distal clavicular fracture.

                                 FINAL REPORT

 INDICATION;  SOB and right-sided chest pain.  Prior carcinoid tumor resection.

 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  Comparison made to study of [**2186-9-26**]. No definite
 pneumothorax is visualized.  There are changes from volume rectuctive surgery
 in the right lung with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and hilum and
 partial resection of the right 5th rib which are all unchanged in appearance.
 New on the current study is a soft tissue density located just above the right
 hilum which demonstrates a linear component, with a suggestion of tethering of
 adjacent structures.  The linear areas could represent changes from prior
 radiation, but the soft tissue nature and tethering appearance are worrisome
 for carcinoid recurrence.  There are no focal consolidations or pleural
 effusions.  Osseous structures are unchanged.

 IMPRESSION: New soft tissue density located immediately superior to right
 hilum.  Differential diagnosis includes post-radiation changes, retractile
 scarring from prior volume reductive surgery, along with soft tissue
 recurrence, and chest CT with IV contrast is recommended for further
 evaluation.

 Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 18244**], the emergency department
 attending, at 8:30 PM on [**2187-5-12**].

 LEFT TIBIA AND FIBULA, AP AND LATERAL VIEW

 INDICATION:  Left tibia and fibular fracture, assess healing.

 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views have been obtained and are compared with a
 similar study dated [**2110-4-19**]. Again a circular cast surrounds the distal
 half of the foreleg and the foot.  The apparent medial tibular plateaufracture
 and its corresponding fixation device remain in unchanged appropriate
 position.  No significant callus formation can be identified.  The comminuted
 distal fractures of both tibia and fibula are again identified.  The tibial
 fracture is supported by a medially applied fixation plate and six penetration
 fixation screws.  The alignment of the fractures is unchanged.  The presence
 of a cast makes it difficult to identify periosteal callus formation but any
 evidence of significant callus formation is doubted.

 IMPRESSION:  No positional change during interval.  No conclusive evidence for
 periodsteal callus formation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: CSFoma. Please drain percutaneously.

 ULTRASOUND GUIDED FLUID COLLECTION DRAINAGE:  Written consent was obtained
 from the patient.  A preprocedure time-out was performed.  The abdomen was
 scanned in the upper quadrant revealing a large fluid collection with a
 catheter in the middle of it representing the VP drain.  An appropriate spot
 was selected on the skin in the right upper quadrant.  This area was prepped
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with
 lidocaine.  A UA catheter was inserted and 250 cc of fluid were drained.
 Despite multiple maneuvers additional fluid cannot be drained.  A second UA
 catheter was inserted adjacent to this after resterilizing and anesthetizing
 the skin.  A total of 2,500 cc of serous fluid were drained. Post drainage
 images show no significant residual fluid.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1716**], the attending
 radiologist, was present and supervising during the critical portions of the
 procedure.  There were no immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION: Approximately 2.5 liters drained from presumed CSFoma. Fluid was
 sent for the requested laboratory studies.

 TECHNIQUE:  Head CT without contrast.

 FINDINGS:  Currently there are no prior studies available in our system for
 comparison.  However, a report from a CT head from [**2126-7-5**] is available.

 There is no intracranial mass effect, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline
 structures or major vascular territorial infarction.  There are areas of
 hypoattenuation present in the left parietal and the right occipital regions.
 These represent old infarctions.  Areas of hypoattenuation are seen around the
 periventricular white matter areas consistent with chronic microvascular
 ischemia.  The density values of the rest of the brain parenchyma are within
 normal limits.  The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures are
 unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of an acute hemorrhage or mass effect. Chronic
 infarcts as above.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: Evaluate for embolic stroke seen on MR.

 COMPARISON: MRI from [**2138-7-2**] and CT head from [**2138-7-1**].

 TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.

 HEAD CT W/O IV CONTRAST: Several low attenuation regions are identified within
 the left frontal lobe, left insula, and left parietal lobe at the junction of
 the [**Doctor Last Name 34**] and white matter. These hypodense areas correspond to the areas of
 restricted diffusion seen on recent MR.  These hypodensities are new since the
 prior CT study, and likely represent evolving infarction.  Again seen is a
 large area of hypodensity with associated encephalomalacic changes involving
 the right temporal, right frontal, and right parietal lobes, consistent with
 prior right middle cerebral artery territorial infarction.  The ventricles are
 stable in size.  No intracranial hemorrhage is identified.  There is no shift
 of normally midline structures.  Visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
 Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:
 1) Interval development of new low attenuation regions at the junction of the
 [**Doctor Last Name 34**] and white matter within the left frontal lobe, left insula, and left
 parietal lobes, which correspond to the areas of restricted diffusoin seen on
 recent MR.  These findings are most suggestive of evolving embolic
 infarctions.

 2) Stable appearance of large right middle cerebral artery territorial
 infarction.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATIONS:  Status post gastric bypass, difficulty in weaning. Evaluate for
 tube position, pneumothorax or fluid.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST:   AP single view of the chest has been obtained with the
 patient in semi-erect position. Poor inspiration explained the rather high
 positioned diaphragms resulting in low pulmonary volume. The patient is
 intubated. The ETT terminating in the trachea some 3 cm above the level of the
 carina. There is no pneumothorax. No conclusive evidence for any new
 parenchymal infiltrate but the high positioned diaphragms and the additional
 motion blurring of the diaphragmatic contours makes detailed assessment
 difficult.  The lateral pleural sinuses are grossly free.

 Comparison is made with the preoperative chest exam of [**2197-8-16**] at which time a
 relatively high positioned right sided diaphragm was observed. In addition,
 the patient had an unusual prominence of the main pulmonary artery raising the
 possibility of pulmonary hypertension.  These findings can again be identified
 on this portable examination.  Comparison does not suggest any significant new
 parenchymal abnormality.

 NG tube tip is off the inferior film edge, not visualized, but in satisfactory
 position.  A right subclavian central venous line tip is also unchanged in
 position in the distal SVC.  Cardiac size and pulmonary vasculature are
 normal.  Patchy areas of opacity are seen in both lung bases, but there are no
 focal consolidations. There is improvement in likely right middle lobe
 atelectasis. Osseous structures are unchanged.

 HISTORY:  Sixty-two year old male with end stage cardiac failure, presents for
 evaluation prior to possible transplant.

 DECISION:  Two sets of resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.
  First set of resting perfusion images were obtained on [**2189-10-2**] following IV
 administration of thallium-201 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
  The second set of resting perfusion images were obtained 24 hours later on
 [**2189-10-2**] following IV administration of an additional 1 mCi of thallium-201.

 FINDINGS:  Left ventricular cavity size is severely enlarged on both days at
 rest.

 On day one, there is moderate-severe myocardial perfusion defect involving the
 inferolateral and inferior walls extending into the apex.

 On day two at 24 hours, there is improved tracer uptake in the inferior wall,
 but unchanged tracer uptake in the inferolateral wall.

 These findings are unchanged following attenuation correction.

 IMPRESSION:  1) Evidence of myocardial viability of the inferior wall.  2) No
 evidence of myocardial viability involving the inferolateral wall.

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  Diagnostic cerebral angiogram to rule out vascular malformation.  DAYCARE UNIT.
   START TIME 10:00.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Patient with right frontal hemorrhage which is
 incongruent with traumatic contusion noted status post traumatic head injury,
 rule out congenital venous abnormality versus AVM.

 POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with no venous anomaly or vascular
 malformation.

 PROCEDURE:  Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.

 INDICATION:  Mr. [**Known lastname 28903**] is a 19 year old male who is status post fall from
 height of approximately 20 feet on [**2168-11-20**] while enibriated.  At that time,
 he suffered an intraparenchymal hemorrhage and contusion which expanded on
 subsequent imaging but this was noted not to have a characteristic appearance
 for contusion because of its depth below the pial surface. MRI and MRA imaging
 was done which raise the possibility of a congenital vascular abnormality
 within this region as well as some suggestion of abnormal flow during the
 right petrous cavernous carotid artery. He is undergoing this diagnostic
 angiography to rule out the possibility of a vascular malformation and to rule
 out carotid intimal injury as suggested by the MRA.

 CONSENT:   The patient and the patient's family was given a full and complete
 explanation of the procedure.  Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits
 and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
 possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
 neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
 complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
 patient and the patient's family understood and wished to proceed with the
 operation.

 ANESTHESIA:  Conscious sedation.

 PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
 placed on the table in supine position. The right groin area was prepped and
 draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
 used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
 arterial blood, a 4 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
 on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
 selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
 right subclavian artery, right vertebral artery, right common carotid artery,
 right internal carotid artery, right external carotid, left common carotid
 artery, left internal carotid, left external carotid artery, left subclavian
 artery, and left vertebral artery.

 RESULTS:  Injection of the right subclavian artery demonstrates normal flow as
 well as a smooth origin of the right vertebral artery which is small in
 caliber of the left vertebral artery.  There is no evidence of stenosis or
 dissection.  Selective catheterization of the right vertebral artery
 demonstrates normal cervical course with contribution to the basilar artery
 without evidence of stenosis dissection or aneurysm.  Note is made of a
 prominent right PICA.  Selective injection of the right common carotid artery
 demonstrates normal cervical course without evidence of dissection and smooth
 appearing carotid bifurcation without evidence of atherosclerosis.  The
 catheter was advanced in position within the right internal carotid artery.
 Selective injection of this artery demonstrates a normal cervical and
 intracranial course without evidence of aneurysm, fistula, or dissection.
 Normal filling of the right anterior middle cerebral artery is appreciated.
 Selective injection of the right external carotid artery demonstrates the
 presence of a small cirsoid  1 to 2 mm aneurysm probably arising from the
 branch in the middle meningeal artery.  Otherwise normal flow distribution is
 appreciated without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
 circulation.  Selective injection of the left common carotid artery
 demonstrates a normal cervical course without evidence of stenosis or
 dissection as well as smooth appearing carotid bifurcation without evidence of
 atherosclerosis.  The catheter was range in position within the left internal
 carotid artery.  Selective injection of this artery demonstrates normal
 intracranial flow pattern without evidence of stenosis, aneurysm, dissection
 or fistula, and selective catheterization of the left external carotid artery
 reveals normal cervical branch pattern without evidence of fistulous
 connection to the intracranial circulation.  Injection of the left subclavian
 artery demonstrates normal anatomy of the vessel itself and smooth origin of
 the left vertebral artery without evidence of stenosis or dissection.  This
 artery has a normal cervical course and intracranial course is relatively
 larger in caliber than the right vertebral artery.  The vertebrobasilar
 junction is observed to the free of dissection aneurysm in the basilar
 arteries and posterior cerebral arteries bilaterally.

 PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left anterior communicating artery aneurysm.

 POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Narrow necked spherical aneurysm of the anterior
 communicating artery which is amenable to endovascular therapy.

 PROCEDURE:  Diagnostic cerebral angiography.

 INDICATION:  Mr. [**Known lastname 18568**] is a 65 year old male who suffered a motorcycle
 crash in [**2146-6-2**] following which he was followed for  numerous injuries
 which included multiple sinus and facial fractures.  At that time, he
 underwent open surgical repair of these fractures, however, the intervening
 time he has had a persistent length of cerebrospinal fluid leak prompting an
 MRI scan of the brain.  An MRI scan at this time demonstrated what appeared to
 be a calcified and partially thrombosed aneurysm of the anterior communicating
 artery complex presents for diagnostic cerebral arteriography to evaluate this
 aneurysm further.

 CONSENT:   The patient and patient's family were given a full and complete
 explanation of the procedure.  Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits
 and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
 possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,

 (Cont)
 used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
 arterial blood, a 4 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
 on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
 selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
 Right subclavian artery, right vertebral artery, right common carotid artery,
 left common carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, left external
 carotid artery, left subclavian artery and left vertebral artery.

 RESULTS:  Injection of the right subclavian artery demonstrates normal
 anatomty of the vessel itself and a normal appearance of the origin of the
 right vertebral artery. The right vertebral artery is diminutive in nature and
 selective catheterization of this artery demonstrates a normal cervical course
 without evidence of stenosis, dissection or aneurysm.  The right vertebral
 artery and a right posterior- inferior cerebellar artery was without evidence
 of aneurysm. Selective injection of the right common carotid artery
 demonstrates a focal plaque at the origin of the right internal carotid artery
 within the carotid bulb.  This is small and hemodynamically insignificant,
 however, there is a small shelf appreciated just distally to it.  The
 remainder of the cervical portion of the right internal carotid artery appears
 within normal limits and was in the intracranial circulation.  The right
 internal carotid artery contributes flow to both the right MCA and ACA
 divisions. Additionally, flow is seen across the anterior communicating artery
 and filling of the left ACA distribution.  A small amount of flow is
 appreciated at the left A1-2 junction within the lumen of the aneurysm.
 Rotational 3D angiography confirmed that the aneurysm seem to fill slowly from
 injection of the right common carotid artery.  Injection of the left common
 carotid artery demonstrates a normal carotid bifurcation without evidence of
 significant stenosis or atherosclerotic plaque. Additionally, injection of the
 left internal carotid artery demonstrates normal cervical course without
 evidence of stenosis, dissection, or fistula and selective injection of the
 left internal carotid again demonstrates fluid across the anterior
 communicating artery as well as better filling of the site of the aneurysm.
 Rotational 3D angiography following the injection of the left internal carotid
 artery demonstrates an approximately 5 x 7 mm area of filling with a narrow
 neck appearance of the left A1-2 junction with the neck measuring perhaps 2 to
 2 1/2 mm widened dimension.  The remainder of the intracranial circulation
 appears within normal limits following injection of the left internal carotid
 artery. Injection of the left external carotid artery demonstrates normal
 branching pattern without evidence of fistulous connection of the intracranial
 circulation.  Injection of the left subclavian artery demonstrates
 normal anatomy of the vessel itself as well as a normal appearance of the left
 vertebral artery origin. Injection of the left vertebral artery demonstrates
 this to be the dominant supply to the posterior circulation with a normal
 appearance of the cervical and intracranial course. Note is made of a
 duplicated superior cerebellar artery on the right and the basilar artery
 contributes flow to both posterior cerebral arteries.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left leg sciatica, rule out left-sided impingement.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous thin section axial images were obtained through the
 lower lumbar spine, confirm the presumptive L2 through S2 levels and
 reconstructed with bone and soft tissue algorithm.  Coronal and sagittal
 reconstructions were also generated.

 LSPINE CT SCAN WITHOUT CONTRAST:

 The patient is status post laminectomy and fusion with bilateral pedicle
 screws at L4 through S1.  Additional screws were seen extending into the iliac
 bones. There is grade II (8/26 mm) anterolisthesis of the presumptive L4
 vertebral body on L5.  There is mild left convex curvature in these images
 obtained with the patient supine.  Vertebral body heights at the visualized
 levels are preserved. Screws are seated within the pedicles and vertebral
 bodies, except for the tips of the screws in L5, which extend anterior to the
 anterior cortex of the vertebral body.  No hardware loosening is detected.
 Soft tissue detail is considerably limited by artifact related to the metal,
 making it essentially impossible to assess fine soft tissue detail of the cord
 and spinal canal. There does appear to be a disc bulge at L3-L4, with
 associated neural foraminal narrowing.  Artifact at L4-L5 obscures soft tissue
 detail, though some disc bulging along the inferior aspect of the neural
 canals may be present. Similarly, at L5-S1, there is considerable artifact due
 to metal.  No definite neural foraminal stenosis.

 Soft tissues posterior to laminectomy defects are abnormal, presumably
 reflecting seroma and/or other postoperative changes. The presence or absence
 infection in this area cannot be excluded and should be correlated clinically.
 Psoas muscles are grossly unremarkable.

 Of note, there is patchy density throughout the sacrum and in portions of the
 iliac bones adjacent to the sacrum, particularly on the right.  There are
 linear lucencies extending through both sacral ala, consistent with sacral
 alar fractures.  An additional fracture line traverses the spine horizontally
 at the level of S1/2 -- although this is centered on the disc and contains
 vacuum phenomena, I cannot exclude a component of fracture there.  In
 addition, cortical interruption is seen along the right iliac bone.

 The [**2178-10-22**] CT scan is not fetching from PACS and is therefore not available
 for comparison at this time. The report describes a left sacral ala fracture

 IMPRESSION:

 1) Status post laminectomy and fusion from L4 through S1, with Grade II
 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.  Suspected disc bulges, but limited assessment of
 central canal due to artifact.  Postoperative changes and/or fluid posterior
 to the laminectomy defect, for which clinical correlation is required.

 2) Fractures of both right and left sacral ala with surrounding sclerosis,
 which is presumed to represent healing.  However, the fracture lines remain
 visible. Cortical interruption also seen in right iliac bone, which appears
 new -- could this have been a graft donor site?   --his requires clinical
 correlation for full assessment.

 3) Dense aortic and common iliac calcification.

 PORTABLE CHEST:

 COMPARISON: [**2159-3-8**].

 INDICATION:  Central line placement.

 A left subclavian vascular catheter is present, terminating at the junction of
 the superior vena cava and right atrium.  A left PICC line is also present,
 but it is difficult to visualize due to superimposition with the more dense
 overlying left subclavian line.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 stable.  There has been interval resolution of previously noted congestive
 heart failure.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with increased
 opacity in the right retrocardiac region.  The left lung is grossly clear.

 IMPRESSION: 1)  Left subclavian vascular catheter in satisfactory position
 with no pneumothorax.
 2)  Difficulty visualizing left PICC line.  Dedicated PA and lateral chest
 radiograph could be obtained for this purpose.
 3) Elevation of right hemidiaphragm with adjacent retrocardiac opacity likely
 due to a combination of atelectasis and effusion.  Attention to this on a PA
 and lateral view would also be helpful if warranted clinically.

 The focal previously described 3 mm cyst at the level of the right
 caudothalamic groove is now slightly larger and measures 5 mm and has a
 slightly bilobed appearance. This may represent resolution of a grade I
 germinal matrix hemorrhage or a choroid plexus cyst. There is no evidence of
 hydrocephalus or hemorrhage. Sulci and gyri are symmetric bilaterally. The
 midline structures and posterior fossa appear normal.

 INDICATION:  Status post trauma, reassess pneumothorax.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the chest with IV contrast using 100 cc of
 Optiray.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The patient has been extubated.  Right-sided chest
 tube is again seen.  There remains a small medial and basal right-sided
 pneumothorax, not significantly changed compared to the prior study.  The left
 upper lobe opacity seen on the prior study thought to represent contusion has
 largely cleared.  There is diffuse emphysema.  There is bibasilar atelectasis
 and a small right-sided pleural effusion with associated
 atelectasis/consolidation.  Right-sided clavicular fracture again noted. There
 are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the axillary, mediastinal or
 hilar distributions.  The airways are patent to the segmental level.  The
 aorta, heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The central pulmonary arteries
 enhance normally, without evidence of intraluminal thrombus.  The peripheral
 branches of the pulmonary arteries are not well evaluated on this study.
 Limited axial images through the upper abdomen demonstrate multiple hypodense
 lesions throughout the liver, likely simple cyst, but too small to
 definitively characterize.  The gallbladder is distended and appears to
 contain extravasation of contrast.  No secondary signs to suggest
 cholecystitis.

 IMPRESSION:
 1) Stable small right-sided medial/basal pneumothorax.
 2) No evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
 3) Interval clearing of left upper lobe opacity, likely consistent with
 resolving contusion.
 4) Emphysema.
 5) Bibasilar atelectasis with a small right-sided effusion with associated
 atelectasis/consolidation.
 6) Left clavicular fracture and right sided rib fracrtures.
 7) Multiple tiny hypodensities within the liver, likely representing simple
 cysts, but too small to characterize.
 8) Slightly prominent appearing gallbladder with extraneous IV contrast within
 it. No other CT findings to suggest cholecystitis; correlate clinically.

 INDICATION:  Status post motorcycle accident.

 AP view of the chest dated [**2100-8-2**] shows a chest tube terminating in the
 right lung apex.  The heart, hilar, and mediastinal contours are normal for
 the technique.  An endotracheal tube has been repositioned to terminate 5 cm
 above the carina.  There is a thin lucency along the medial pleural surface
 along the descending aortic contour, suggesting pneumothorax.  The lung fields
 are grossly clear.  The NG tube courses through the esophagus to terminate in
 the gastric antrum.  The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  Appropriate positioning of endotracheal and nasogastric tube.
 Lucency overlying the medial aspect of the left pleura is likely related to
 the patient's known pneumothorax.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Radiologist call back.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted imaging of the cervical spine was
 obtained.
 FINDINGS:  Please note that the original dictation was lost in the PACS
 transcription archive- this is a redictation.

 Comparison with the prior study of [**6-6**] reveals improved image quality, and
 confirmation of the presence of a large, posteriorly situated epidural
 hematoma, which appears to extend from the C6-7 to approximately the T4 level
 of the spine. There is moderate cord compression, and likely a small amount of
 elevated T2 signal in the compressed cord, suggesting edema.

 There is also moderate prevertebral soft tissue swelling, again extending from
 the skull base as far distally as the C5 level. As it was apparent that the
 patient was taking Coumadin, and manifested an INR of 8, this radiological
 finding could certainly represent a prevertebral hematoma, as opposed to edema
 secondary to ligamentous disruption.

 The posteriorly situated paraspinal edema apparently relates to non-displaced
 fractures of the spinous processes of C5 and C6, not initially detected on the
 prior day's CT scan but confirmed upon review of this study. (Inquiry by
 telephone to the staff caring for the patient, immediately after this MR study
 was obtained,  to notify them of these fractures resulted in information
 indicating that the patient had been maintained in a hard cervical collar, up
 to the time of this MR study, thus minimizing any issues that might arise from
 potential mechanical instability of the spine from bony or ligamentous
 injuries.

 The mid-cervical spondylytic changes are again seen as well as  the elevated
 T2 signal patterns within the T2 and T3 vertebral bodies. Even upon reviewing
 the prior cervical CT scan, which extended as far caudally as T2, no fracture
 was seen involving that vertebral body.  Perhaps the abnormal T2 signal
 represented a bone bruise.  The right sided posterior paraspinal hemorrhages,
 seen on the prior MR study are better delineated at this time, likely due to
 the availability of T2- weighted axial scans.  However, these abnormal regions
 were seen on the prior MR [**Name13 (STitle) 26441**] sagittal T2 weighted images.

 CONCLUSION:  Complex multicompartmental spinal hemorrhages, including an
 epidural hemorrhage.  The findings of this study were communicated immediately
 to the trauma team caring for the patient following the conclusion of this
 examination.  As potential evacuation of the epidural hemorrhage was being
 contemplated, it was decided to obtain a follow up thoracic and lumbar spine
 imaging study to provide complete depiction of the spinal cord and cauda
 equina,  and rule out any other hemorrhages being present more distally.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  83-year-old in motor vehicle accident.

 TECHNIQUE:  VCT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after the
 administration of 150 cc of IV Optiray.  Multiplanar reformatted images were
 obtained.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a small left pleural effusion.
 Several nonpathologically enlarged prevascular lymph nodes are seen.  There is
 no significant axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Lung window images
 demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis.  Severe emphysematous changes are seen
 throughout both lung fields.  Two large bullae are seen at the left lung base.
 One of these has a fluid level within it.  There are small, bilateral anterior
 pneumothoraces.  The main pulmonary artery is enlarged, measuring 4.4 cm and
 consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  There is no evidence of vascular
 injury.  The heart and pericardium are unremarkable other than coronary
 calcifications.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a tiny gallstone seen within the
 gallbladder.  A tiny hypodensity is seen within the spleen, which is too small
 to characterize.  In addition, there is a splenic granuloma.  The liver,
 gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenals, and intra-abdominal large and small
 bowel are otherwise unremarkable.  Cysts are seen within both kidneys, the
 largest of which is in the left mid pole and measures 6.7 x 6.4 cm.  No free
 fluid, free air, or pathologic lymphadenopathy is seen within the abdomen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid, distal ureters, and
 bladder are normal in appearance.  No free fluid or lymphadenopathy is seen
 within the pelvis.  Note is made of a left common iliac artery aneurysm
 measuring approximately 1.6 cm.

 The osseous structures demonstrate posterior rib fractures of the left 7th
 through 10th ribs.  The vertebral bodies appear unremarkable on the sagittal
 reformatted images.  Soft tissues demonstrate a hematoma in the region of the
 left posterior rib fractures.

 INDICATION:  83-year-old in motor vehicle accident.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the cervical spine without IV contrast.  Multiplanar
 reformatted images were obtained.  No prior studies.

 FINDINGS:  There is a type-[**12-24**] fracture through the dens, without significant
 displacement of fracture fragments. The fracture involves the right articular
 mass, body and left articular mass, and extends through the left transverse
 process (and across the vertebral canal). A small fracture fragment seen
 posterior to the dens within the spinal canal, and may impress the cord. Ther
 may also be an epidural hematoma. There is also a transverse fracture through
 the spinous process of C5. There is a questionable fracture at the C3 left
 facet joint, though this may just represent severe degenerative changes. Soft
 tissue hematoma is seen within the prevertebral soft tissues anterior to C2
 and 3.

 Severe degenerative changes are noted throughout the cervical spine with disc
 space narrowing, subchondral cyst formation, and mild osteophyte formation.
 The cervical canal is also slightly narrowed in the mid cervical spine.

 Several small lymph nodes are seen within the neck.

 IMPRESSION:  Type-[**12-24**] fracture through the dens.  Transverse fractures through
 the posterior elements of C5.  Severe degenerative changes throughout the
 cervical spine. Evaluation of the spinal canal and cord with MRI should be
 considered.
 These findings were communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2120**] at the completion of the
 examination.

 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen [**2115-5-25**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases through the
 symphysis pubis after the administration of 100 cc of nonionic Optiray
 contrast.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is a cavitary lesion in the right lung
 base with mild surrounding air-space opacities.  There was a consolidation in
 this region on the previous exam, much of which has resolved.  There are no
 pleural effusions. There is a small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion.
 The transplant liver enhances homogeneously and is unremarkable.  Non-
 occlusive stable thrombus is seen within the portal vein.  Two metallic
 biliary stents are seen in place with a small amount of biliary air. No free
 intraperitoneal air is identified. Clips and sutures are identified relating
 to the transplant liver. A pacing wire is identified within the heart.  The
 pancreas and kidneys are stable and unremarkable.  The left kidney is slightly
 malrotated. The spleen is again enlarged and demonstrates a small infarct,
 which is stable. There is diffuse soft tissue stranding within the
 subcutaneous tissue consistent with mild anasarca.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The opacified loops of small bowel are
 unremarkable.  There is wall thickening involving the ascending and transverse
 colon with mild surrounding fat stranding.  There are likely scattered mildly
 thickened areas within the sigmoid and descending colon also.  No free fluid
 or abnormal fluid collections are identified within the abdomen or pelvis.
 There is a 3- cm soft tissue mass just posterior to the left ischial
 tuberosity which was not seen on the previous study and is likely a benign
 fluid collection.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.

 popliteal levels bilaterally.  All other wave forms  are monophasic and that
 at the left PT level was not interpreted due to overlying dressing.  ABI
 measurements are inconclusive due to vessel non-compressibility.  Volume
 recordings demonstrate significant wave form widening at the ankle and
 metatarsal levels bilaterally.

 IMPRESSION:  Findings as stated above which indicate significant bilateral
 tibial disease.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Long-standing right lower lobe pneumonia, associated right
 effusion, status post thoracentesis.

 Comparison is made to the prior chest CT dated [**2190-5-19**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed without
 administration of intravenous contrast.  Intravenous contrast was withheld
 secondary to elevated creatinine.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There has been interval
 decrease in the previously identified right-sided pleural effusion.  There is
 a continued markedly loculated moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion,
  along the major fissure.  There are also several smaller right-sided pleural-
 based loculated effusions.  Multifocal areas of discoid and linear atelectasis
 are also appreciated in the lungs bilaterally, best appreciated in the left
 lower lobe.  A left-sided PICC line is again present in stable position.

 The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable.  There are no
 pathologically enlarged areas of adenopathy.  Note is made of a prominent
 right paratracheal lymph node measuring approximately 9 mm in short axis and
 several small mediastinal and subcarinal lymph nodes which may be reactive.
 The airways remain patent to the segmental level bilaterally.  The visualized
 portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. A heterogeneous nodule is
 again appreciated in the inferior left lobe of the thyroid.  The visualized
 portions of the upper abdomen are remarkable for a small dense stone in the
 right renal collecting system.

 IMPRESSION:

 1)  Decrease of previously identified right-sided effusion with continued
 markedly loculated moderate-sized right-sided effusion.  There has been
 reexpansion of the right lower lobe with continued multifocal areas of
 atelectasis.  While the etiology of this loculated effusion is presumably due
 to pneumonia, the radiologic differential diagnosis also includes sequela of
 collagen vascular disease, malignancy, or TB if an infectious etiology is not
 clearly established.

 2)  Left thyroid nodule as discussed previously.

 tube has been removed.  The NG tube courses below the diaphragm.  There
 remains a right internal jugular central venous line terminating in the
 superior vena cava.  There is no pneumothorax.  The lung fields are grossly
 clear.  There is a layering right pleural effusion, and a small left pleural
 effusion remaining.  There remains minimal bibasilar atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION:  Left chest tube removal.  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged layering
 right pleural effusion and small left basilar pleural effusion.  Minimal
 bibasilar atelectasis.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tense abdomen, elevated LFTs.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained with 5-mm slice
 thickness without oral or intravenous contrast.  Intravenous contrast was
 deferred at the request of the ordering physicians due to a recent rise in
 creatinine.

 Comparison is made with the prior CT dated [**2125-5-16**].

 CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are moderately-sized bilateral pleural
 effusions, with bibasilar collapse and consolidation.

 There is extensive fatty infiltration of the liver, as before.  Gallstones are
 noted.  Unenhanced adrenals, kidneys, and spleen are unremarkable.

 There is moderate ascites, new since the prior study.  Though there is diffuse
 infiltration of the mesentery with free fluid, the inflammatory process does
 not appear to be centered around the pancreas, and is therefore not felt to be
 related to a primary pancreatic process.

 Unenhanced pancreas appears grossly unremarkable, however, since intravenous
 contrast was not administered, pancreatic necrosis and patency of the
 peripancreatic arteries and veins cannot be assessed.

 There is diffuse wall edema involving the small bowel; however, no pneumatosis
 is identified.

 A feeding tube is identified with its tip in the gastric antrum.  No free
 intraperitoneal air.

 CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is diffuse wall thickening surrounding
 the entire colon, again with no pneumatosis.  A Foley catheter is seen within
 the urinary bladder.  Unenhanced seminal vesicles and prostate gland appear
 grossly unremarkable.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious bony lesions.

 IMPRESSION:

 1)  New diffuse ascites and diffuse small bowel and colonic wall thickening.

 Possibilities include extensive third spacing (does the patient have liver
 failure or sepsis?), however, other etiologies would include peritonitis.
 Bowel ischemia is less likely given the involvement of multiple vascular
 distributions of the gastrointestinal tract.

 2) Limited evaluation of the pancreas given lack of intravenous contrast.
 Pancreatic necrosis and peripancreatic vessel patency cannot be assessed.

 3)  Bibasilar collapse and consolidation, with pleural effusions as noted.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic
 symphysis were acquired with oral and rectal contrast without IV contrast.
 Displayed with 5 mm sized thickness.

 COMPARISONS:  Prior study of [**2156-9-20**].

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  Again noted are emphysematous changes of the lungs and
 scarring of the lung bases.  The heart is unremarkable.  There has been
 interval removal of the gastrostomy tube.  There is a hypoattenuating lesion
 in the right lobe at the dome of the liver, which is too small to characterize
 (series 2, image 5).  The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  The
 pancreas is within normal limits.  There is no free air or free fluid in the
 abdomen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The previously seen drain in the suprapubic
 region has been removed.  Linear soft tissue density along the track of the
 previous drain may represent scar. The bowel wall thickening in the region of
 the prior drain has resolved.  Small mesenteric calcification noted. Multiple
 small lymph nodes are seen in the retroperitoneum and mesentery. There is a
 Left lower quadrant colostomy and mucous fistula. No contrast extravasation is
 seen.  There are bilateral inguinal lymph nodes.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious or sclerotic lesions are seen.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of G-tube and suprapubic drainage catheter.
 2.  Resolution of inflammatory changes in the area of the prior superpubic
 drain.
 3.  No evidence of contrast extravasation, suggesting interval closure of
 entero-sigmoid and enterocutaneous fistula.
 4. Unchanged emphysematous changes and scarring at lung bases.

 INDICATION:  72-year-old male with aortic dissection.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images of the chest were obtained without the
 administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 1511**].  Contiguous axial images of the chest,
 abdomen, and pelvis were obtained with administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 1511**],
 120 cc of Optiray.  Multiplanar reformation images are reconstructed.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison was made to the prior CTA study dated [**2123-12-1**].

 FINDINGS:

 AORTA AND GREAT VESSELS:  Again note is made of type B aortic dissection
 starting from aortic arch, extending down to the level of just above iliac
 bifurcation, overall unchanged compared to the prior study.  Note is made of
 slow flow in the false lumen in the descending aorta.  Arch vessels are coming
 off from true lumen.  Celiac trunk, SMA, and left renal arteries are coming
 off from the true lumen, however, right renal artery is coming off from the
 false lumen, with hypoperfusion to the right kidney with fat stranding, as
 noted previously.  Again note is made of small segmental dissection in the
 right common iliac artery, unchanged compared to the prior study, with partial
 mural thrombus.

 CHEST:  Again note is made of small mediastinal nodes, unchanged compared to
 the prior study.  Coronary arteries are calcified.  Previously noted
 pericardial and pleural effusion has decreased in its amount.  Note is made of
 gynecomastia.  In the lung window, again note is made of small lung cyst in
 the right upper lobe, and peribronchial thickening, in the right upper lobe,
 unchanged compared to the prior study.  No new suspicious mass or nodule is
 seen.

 ABDOMEN:  The liver is normal without evidence of focal liver lesion.
 Gallbladder is normal without evidence of calcification.  Pancreas, spleen,
 adrenal glands, and the left kidney, and the visualized portion of large and
 small intestines are within normal limits.  Hypoperfusion of the right kidney
 with fat stranding is seen as described above.  Again note is made of small
 renal cyst.  No ascites.  No significant lymphadenopathy.

 PELVIS:  The visualized portion of large and small intestines is within normal
 limits.  Again note is made of diverticulosis.  No ascites.  No significant
 lymphadenopathy.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Aphasia and right-sided deficit.

 TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT scan.

 FINDINGS:  There are no prior head CT or MR studies available for comparison.

 There is a moderate-sized chronic right parietal lobe infarct seen above the
 level of the lateral ventricles.  There may be a punctate chronic lacunar
 infarct within the left lentiform nucleus as well as the body of the right
 caudate nucleus.  Images at these levels are suboptimal due to patient motion.
 There is no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  Considering patient age,
 there is the expected involutional change of the brain parenchyma.

 There is extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous portions of
 both internal carotid arteries.  There is mild asymmetry of the fossa of
 Rosenmuller, the left being slightly less capacious than the right, as
 visualized on the more cephalad images.  The clinical significance of this
 finding is uncertain.  If there is any concern for the possibility of
 neoplastic disease in this locale, dedicated MR imaging would be helpful.

 CONCLUSION:  No definite evidence for acute brain ischemia, although this
 study is obviously far less sensitive in this regard than MRI scanning with
 diffusion-weighted imaging.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD

 TECHNIQUE:  Bolus intravenously enhanced imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  The major vascular tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 501**] appear
 patent.  Once again, there is extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  23-year-old in sledding accident with abdominal pain and frank
 blood from Foley catheter.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.  150 cc of Optiray
 was used for this examination.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
 obtained.

 No prior studies.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases are clear.  There is
 complete fracture of the left kidney with what appears to be avulsion from its
 pedicle and active extravasation of arterial contrast seen in the renal space.
 A large amount of hematoma is seen throughout the left renal space as well as,
 likely within the left retroperitoneum.  Small amount of low attenuation is
 seen surrounding the renal space, presumably pararenal fat.  The left renal
 artery is seen at its takeoff from the aorta (series 2, image 36) and appears
 intact.  However, approximately 1.5 cm from the takeoff of the left renal
 artery, contrast is seen to be actively extravasating within the fractured
 left kidney.  There are also varying densities of hematoma seen.  The celiac
 axis and superior mesenteric axis appear intact.  The splenic artery appears
 intact. Of note, the massive hematoma displaces normal bowel and stomach.

 The spleen, liver, right kidney, right adrenal, visualized portion of the
 pancreas, and intra-abdominal large and small bowel are normal in appearance.
 The patient is post-cholecystectomy with clips seen in the right upper
 quadrant.  No free air is present.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Fluid is seen tracking into the pelvis,
 consistent with hematoma.  There also appears to be a small amount of simple
 fluid seen within the deep pelvis.  The rectum and sigmoid are collapsed.  A
 Foley catheter is seen within a collapsed bladder.  No contrast material is
 seen within the bladder at this point.  The uterus is unremarkable other than
 a small amount of fluid within endometrium.  The right ovary is normal.

 Soft tissues are normal in appearance.  Osseous structures are unremarkable
 with no fractures identified.

 foot, 3 vws

 There is severe diffuse osteopenia.  There is narrowing and irregularity of
 the joint spaces at the tarsometatarsal joint.  In appropriate clinical
 setting, this is most suggestive of neuroarthropathic change.  Faint vascular
 calcification is present.  There is a focal erosion centered on the medial
 aspect of the first TMT joint -- the edges appear well corticated and
 nonaggressive and therefore not likely secondary to an acute infection.  No
 focal bone destruction to confirm the presence of osteomyelitis is identified.
 Correlation with specific site of any skin findings, particularly if there is
 ulceration, is recommended for full assessment.

 MRI EXAM OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITH CONTRAST.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Renal cell cancer with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]-Lindau disease and
 status post surgical resection of the conus.

 MRI exam of the thoracic spine was obtained without and with intravenous
 gadolinium administration.  Correlation is made to prior thoracic spine MRI
 from [**2147-8-10**].  The vertebral bodies maintain their normal height.
 The patient has undergone posterior decompression laminectomies extending from
 T10-11 through T12-L1 levels.  There is a nodular enhancing lesion abutting
 the posterior aspect of the lower thoracic cord at T10-11 level measuring 6 x
 5 mm.  There is associated T2 hyperintensity within the lower thoracic cord as
 noted on the previous exam.  There is linear enhancement also noted along the
 posterior aspect of the lower thoracic cord extending from T8 through T10
 levels.  There is minimal enhancement seen involving the distal aspect of the
 thoracic cord at T12 level.  Spinal canal has been decompressed.  No new
 enhancing lesions are seen within the cord following intravenous gadolinium
 administration.  There are several lesions within the right lobe of the liver
 posteriorly consistent with liver metastases.  The overall T2 hyperintense
 signal within the distal thoracic cord has worsened since the previous exam
 indicating possible slight enlargement of the nodular-enhancing lesion within
 the cord at T10-11 level.

 IMPRESSION:  Slightly worsening T2 hyperintensity along the distal aspect of
 the thoracic cord with persistent nodular enhancement posteriorly at T10-11
 level.  There is also minor linear enhancement along the posterior surface of
 the cord extending from T10 through T8 levels superiorly.  The findings are
 consistent with residual tumor.  Enhancing lesions are seen within the right
 lobe of the liver consistent with liver metastases.  The lower thoracic canal
 has been surgically decompressed by central laminectomies.

 enhanced images of the cervical spine.  Additional linear enhancing lesions
 are seen along the ventral and dorsal aspect of the surface of the cord at C1-
 C2 level.  Other tiny smaller subtle enhancing lesions are noted along the
 posterior surface of the cord along the leptomeninges suggestive of
 leptomeningeal or drop metastases.  There is no underlying cord edema seen.

 The spinal canal is patent.  Homogeneous signal is noted within the cervical
 cord.  There is mild reversal of the normal cervical lordosis.  Annular bulges
 are present at C5-C6 and C6-C7 levels.  There is no extrinsic cord compression
 seen.

 IMPRESSION:  Several enhancing lesions overlying the surface of the cord
 suggestive of leptomeningeal or drop metastases.  There is no underlying cord
 edema or extrinsic cord compression.  Small tiny nodular enhancing lesions are
 noted involving the posterior cervicomedullary junction.  The patient has
 known hemangioblastoma of the cerebellum as noted on the previous brain MRI
 from [**2148-2-5**].

 Note is made of an enlarged lesion within the right lobe of the thyroid as
 noted on the previous CT of the patient's abdomen performed on [**2148-1-1**].  The right thyroid lesion measures 2.5 x 2.2 cm.

 INDICATION:  Severe unexplained highly labile hypertension.  Evaluate for
 renal artery stenosis.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplaner MR imaging of the abdomen was obtained with images
 dynamically obtained before, during, and after the administration of IV
 Gadolinium.  There are no comparison studies.

 Multiplanar reformatted and volume rendered images were also reviewed on an
 independent workstation.

 FINDINGS:

 MRA of the renal arteries shows a mild narrowing of the left renal ostium as
 well as a high-grade stenosis just beyond the right renal ostium.

 Both kidneys show mild renal cortical thinning.  There is slight prominence of
 the left adrenal gland.  The infrarenal abdominal aorta is borderline
 aneurysmal, measuring up to 3 cm in diameter, with atherosclerotic change. The
 takeoffs of the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery are not evaluated
 within the field of this scan.

 The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  The common bile duct is mildly
 enlarged, measuring up to 1.3 cm in diameter, likely partially due to the fact
 the patient is status post cholecystectomy.  The inferior aspect of the common
 bile duct tapers towards the pancreatic head without evidence of abrupt cutoff
 or obstructing mass.

 The visualized portion of the pancreas and pancreatic duct appear normal.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  High-grade right-sided renal artery stenosis just beyond the ostium, and
 mild narrowing of the left renal artery at the ostium.
 2)  Mild bilateral renal cortical thinning.
 3)  Atherosclerotic changes of the aorta, including borderline aneurysmal
 change of the infrarenal aorta.

 Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7319**] on [**2166-7-7**].

 HISTORY:  Motor vehicle collision, assess chest tubes and central lines.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**9-19**] at 7:51 p.m.:

 In the past four hours, mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has developed with
 substantially more left perihilar opacification which could represent
 pulmonary contusion.  The greater diameter of the mediastinum in the region of
 the descending thoracic aorta should be considered in light of mechanism of
 injury to determine whether there could be arterial injury or other cause of
 mediastinal hematoma.  ET tube is in standard placement.  Tip of the Swan-
 Ganz catheter projects over the right descending pulmonary artery.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.  Severe
 subcutaneous emphysema in the left breast and axilla is stable.  Left pleural
 tube impinges on the mediastinum at the level of the left hilus.  Tiny apical
 pleural air collection is present.  A second pleural tube projecting over the
 right apex, has at least its side port in the soft tissues, may not be
 intratthoracic; it is responsible for new subcutaneous emphysema along the
 right chest wall laterally.  ET tube is in standard placement.

 AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2150-11-8**] AT 1543 HOURS

 HISTORY:  New left subclavian dialysis catheter placement.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, including earlier, same day.

 FINDINGS:  The submitted radiograph is mislabeled in terms of side.  The left
 side of the patient has been marked right.  This has been submitted to the
 quality assurance program for correction.

 Consistent with the given history, there is a small-bore dual-lumen catheter
 from a presumed left subclavian approach.  Assessment is hindered secondary to
 rotation.  As best can be determined, the catheter tip terminates in the
 region of the more cephalad superior vena cava, at least 9 cm proximal to the
 cavoatrial junction.  However, technical limitations may limit visualization
 of the true tip of the catheter.  A PA catheter is again noted from a right
 internal jugular approach in relatively stable position with the distal tip in
 the proximal right main pulmonary artery.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes
 are also stable.  There is poor visualization of the left hemidiaphragm which
 is in part due to respiratory motion.  Layering pleural effusion cannot be
 entirely excluded.  There may be an element of mild hydrostatic edema although
 again artifact may result in the pulmonary vascular indistinctness.

 IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited study secondary to multiple factors including
 mislabeling, rotation, and respiratory motion during the acquisition.  No
 definite pneumothorax is visualized.  Repeat study is likely indicated.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATIONS:  76-year-old woman status post fall.

 COMPARISONS:  The cervical spine can be compared to [**2176-10-25**].  No
 comparison is available for the thoracic spine.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the cervical and
 thoracic spines were performed.

 FINDINGS:  There is mildly exaggerated lordosis of the cervical spine with
 associated exaggerated kyphosis of the mid thoracic spine.  There is mild
 central canal stenosis at C4-C5 and C5-C6 related to mild thickening of the
 ligamentum flavum. However, the signal intensity values of the cord are
 unremarkable and there is no cord compression.  There are no signal
 abnormalities in the soft tissues to suggest ligamentous injury.

 A small focus of hyperintensity on both T1- and T2-weighted imaging and C4 may
 represent a hemangioma.  Patchy fatty infiltration is visualized among other
 cervical vertebral bodies.

 The alignment of the thoracic spine is also preserved without listhesis.  The
 signal intensity values of the thoracic cord are normal.  Patchy fatty
 infiltration is noted among thoracic vertebral bodies.  Foci of hyperintensity
 on T1- weighted imaging in T7 and T10 probably represent hemangiomas or
 additional foci of fatty infiltration.  There is a mild anterior wedge
 compression fracture of T12, which shows, however, no abnormal signal
 intensity characteristics to suggest that it is recent.

 At T11-T12, there is a mild paracentral disc protrusion, with mild canal
 stenosis, without cord compression.  Partial fusion of L1 and L2 is noted,
 probably degenerative in etiology.

 There is a 3.8-cm diameter cyst along the right renal cortex.  Additional
 subcentimeter T2 intense foci in the left kidney probably represent parapelvic
 renal cysts.  There are also at least two T2 hyperintense lesions in the
 thyroid, which are not well characterized here.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  73-year-old female with mental status changes, with right hip
 fracture, to evaluate for bleed/mass.

 No prior studies for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT of the head.

 FINDINGS:

 There is a large, 3-cm cystic area in the right occipital lobe with
 porencephalic dilatation of the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 218**].  This finding could
 represent chronic infarct in the right posterior cerebral artery territory. No
 evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline
 structures are apparent. Prominent ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are
 noted, secondary to involutional changes. The osseous and the soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.  The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses
 and the orbits are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  3-cm cystic area in the right occipital lobe with porencephalic dilatation
 of the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 218**], which could represent a chronic infarct in the
 right PCA territory- correlate this observation clinically, and if doubt
 remains as to etiology, a follow-up brain MRI scan with IV contrast is
 recommended.
 2.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect/midline shift.

 Findings noted on the ED dashboard on [**2175-2-1**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15748**].

 INDICATION:  50-year-old male with ETOH abuse and elevated LFTs.

 COMPARISONS:  None.

 FINDINGS:  Study is extremely limited secondary to patient body habitus.  The
 liver is diffusely echogenic consistent with fatty infiltration.  Nodular
 hepatic contour is consistent with underlying cirrhosis.  There is no definite
 intraparenchymal mass or biliary ductal dilatation.  The common bile duct
 measures 3 mm and is not dilated.  Some sludge is noted within a mildly
 distended gallbladder.  Mild gallbladder wall thickening is present without
 adjacent pericholecystic fluid. A large amount of perihepatic ascites is
 identified.   Limited pulse doppler and color flow examination demonstrates
 hepatofugal flow in the main and right anterior portal veins. The right
 hepatic artery is patent with normal waveforms.  The hepatic veins, left
 portal vein and main/left hepatic arteries were poorly visualized. Limited
 views of the right kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.  Nodular hepatic contour
 indicates significant underlying significant fibrosis/cirrhosis. Assessment
 for hepatic mass is limited.

 2.  Large amount of perihepatic ascites.

 3.  Hepatofugal in the main and right anterior portal veins consistent with
 underlying portal hypertension.  Patent right hepatic artery. Limited
 assessment of the left portal and hepatic veins, and main/left hepatic artery.

 4.  Mild gallbladder wall thickening likely secondary to third spacing given
 the significant ascites and cirrhosis.

 rendered images of the circle of [**Location (un) **].

 CTA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) 124**]:  A large heterogeneous fluid collection is again
 demonstrated along the left cerebral convexity surface, measuring
 approximately 2.8 cm in greatest axial dimension.  Significant mass effect
 exerted upon the left lateral ventricle is again identified along with
 approximately 1.7 cm of rightward subfalcine herniation.  Again, the basal
 cisterns do not appear to be effaced and there is no  evidence of uncal
 herniation.

 No significant stenoses of the visualized portions of the vertebral and
 internal carotid arteries are seen bilaterally.  The circle of [**Location (un) **] and its
 major branches appear patent, and no aneurysms are identified.

 The visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.  The remainder of the
 osseous and soft tissue structures are within normal limits.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Previously noted large left cerebral convexity subdural hematoma producing
 prominent rightward subfalcine herniation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  69-year-old man with large right frontal bleed and ventricular
 drain.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.

 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior examination of [**2179-1-18**], there has
 been expansion of the left frontal intraparenchymal hematoma.  The acute
 hemorrhage now measures 5.7 x 3 cm.  On the prior examination, it measured
 approximately 2.4 x 1.3 cm.  The right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma does
 not appear any larger.  The degree of subfalcine herniation is unchanged.  The
 ventriculostomy catheter is unchanged in position with its tip in the third
 ventricle.  There is an increased amount of blood in the dependent portions of
 the lateral ventricles.  There continues to be blood present in the
 suprasellar cistern, ambient cistern, prepontine cistern, as well as the
 fourth ventricle.  These are relatively unchanged.  The degree of
 hydrocephalus is also unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:  Increase in intraparenchymal hematoma in the left frontal lobe
 around the left frontal ventriculostomy catheter.  The remainder
 of the subarachnoid and intraparenchymal blood is unchanged.  There has been
 slight increase in the amount of intraventricular blood present in the
 dependent portions of the lateral ventricles.  There is an unchanged amount of
 obstructive hydrocephalus.  There has been no increased mass effect upon the
 medial temporal lobes when compared with the CTA of [**2179-1-18**]. However,
 there appears to be slightly increased mass effect upon the right uncus
 compared to the original study of [**2179-1-18**], at 21:45.  This would
 indicate progressing uncal herniation.

 The findings were discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3092**] at the time of dictation.

                                 FINAL REPORT

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  89-year-old male with right-sided cerebellar
 hemorrhage and suspected posterior fossa aneurysm.  Further evaluation with
 conventional angiogram.

 CONSENT:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient after the procedure
 with its indications, risks, benefits, and alternative options were explained
 to him.  The explained risks included that of stroke, loss of vision and
 speech, temporary or permanent, with possible treatment with stent and coils
 if necessary.

 COMPARISON:  Correlated with the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] head of [**2179-1-3**].

 TECHNIQUE:  The patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology room
 and placed on the biplane table in supine position.  Both groins were prepped
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Under local anesthesia with 1%
 lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and aseptic precautions, access to the
 right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19 gauge needle via a single
 wall puncture technique.  Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 94**] wire was
 introduced and the needle was taken out.  Over the wire, 5 French vascular
 sheath was placed and connected to saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500
 units in 500 cc of saline) with a continuous drip.  Through the sheath, a 4
 French Berenstein catheter was introduced and connected to continuous saline
 infusion (1000 units of heparin in 1000 cc of saline).

 The following vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms performed
 from these locations:  Left vertebral artery, right common carotid artery,
 right vertebral artery.  Images were obtained in AP, lateral as well as
 rotational 3-D projections.

 FINDINGS:  There is a 4.2 x 4.0, broad necked, posteriorly/laterally directed
 aneurysm originating from the right superior cerebellar artery.

 There is severe short segment stenosis in the left vertebral artery,
 approximately 1 cm proximal to the origin of the posterior inferior
                                                             (Over)

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1037**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed the procedure.  Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 1037**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  As no suitable superficial veins were visible,
 ultrasound was used to localize a suitable vein.  The left brachial vein was
 patent and compressible.  The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in
 sterile fashion.  Two cc of 1% lidocaine were used for local anesthesia. Under
 ultrasonographic guidance, a 21-gauge needle was advanced into the left
 brachial vein, and a 0.018-inch guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
 guidance into the SVC.  Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and
 after venous access documenting vessel patency. The needle was exchanged for a
 4.5 French micropuncture sheath. By the markings on the wire, it was
 determined that a length of 47 cm was suitable. The PICC catheter was trimmed
 to length and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC.  The wire and
 peel-away sheath were removed.  A final fluoroscopic spot image of the chest
 demonstrates the tip of the PICC in the distal SVC. The catheter was flushed,
 hep-locked, and statlocked.  Patient tolerated the procedure well and there
 were no complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 47-cm left brachial vein PICC with the
 tip in the SVC.  The line is ready for use.

 CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  69-year-old woman with history of AAA repair with ?
 ischemic bowel.  Assess for bowel ischemia/pneumatosis.

 Comparison made to prior study dated [**2187-12-1**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple transaxial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
 with and without intravenous contrast.  Coronally and sagittally reformatted
 images were also obtained.

 CT ABDOMEN:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
 right, with adjacent compressive atelectasis with interval increase in size. A
 nasogastric tube is in place.  No pericardial effusions.

 The liver is normal in size and appearance, without focal hepatic lesions.
 There are gallstones. Otherwise, the gallbladder is unremarkable.  The
 pancreas and spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable.

 There is absent perfusion of the right kidney, which demonstrated normal
 perfusion on the preoperative CT of [**2187-12-1**].  No arterial flow identified in
 right renal artery.  Notably, the right renal artery originates at an
 atypically inferior position from the aorta, at the site of the prior region
 of aneurysmal dilation and subsequent surgical repair.  The left kidney is
 well perfused and the left renal artery is widely patent. There is bilateral
 perinephric stranding.

 The patient is post surgical repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 There is persistent fluid in the right abdomen, that is not increased in size.
 Note is made of a splenorenal shunt, as seen previously.

 There is mild thickening of a segment of the left colon (sequence 3B, image
 #333).  A thin ring of gas at the periphery of a short segment of right colon
 most likely represents stool compressing intraluminal gas (sequence 3B, image
 #328), and is unlikely to represent focal pneumatosis.  There is mild
 dilatation of loops of small bowel.  There is a large left anterior abdominal
 hernia, although there is a wide mouth and does not appear to be any bowel
 compromise. Inferiorly, there is a small amount of gas and fluid with an
 associated air- fluid level (sequence 3B, image #397), most likely
                                                             (Over)

 representing sequela of prior ruptured aortic aneurysm and subsequent surgery.

 CT PELVIS:  There is a Foley catheter in the urinary bladder, which is
 decompressed. There is a small amount of pelvic free fluid.  No pelvic or
 inguinal lymphadenopathy.

 There are degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.

 Multiplanar reformatted images were useful in delineation of the above
 findings.

 Findings were discussed with house officers, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 436**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10236**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
 [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5629**].

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  In this patient that is post open repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic
 aneurysm, there is absent perfusion of the right kidney.
 2.  No evidence of pneumatosis, as clinically questioned. Mild left colonic
 wall thickening and mildly dilated loops of small bowel, which are nonspecific
 findings, however, can be seen in the setting of bowel ischemia. Recommend
 close interval followup and clinical correlation.
 3.  Gallstones.
 4.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectases.

 PROCEDURE:

 1.  Abdominal aortography, selective splenic arteriography, selective hepatic
 arteriography, via right transfemoral approach.

 2.  Moderate intravenous pseudoanalgesia.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 924**], the Attending Radiologist, present and
 supervising the entire procedure.

 DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Informed consent for the procedures above was
 obtained from the patient.  The patient was then transferred to the
 angiography Suite.


 Timeout was performed to identify the patient, the procedures to be performed,
 the site of the procedure, and appropriate requisition material.  Once the
 above were verified, the patient's right groin was prepped and draped in the
 usual sterile fashion.  Uneventful one wall arterial puncture was achieved at
 the common femoral artery.  Flush abdominal aortic injection was made, which
 demonstrated the suprarenal abdominal aorta to be widely patent as are the
 superior mesenteric and celiac axis branches.  Subsequently, selective
 catheterization of the splenic artery was made, where upon a power injection
 was made depicting an enlarged tortuous splenic artery without evidence of
 stenosing or obstructing lesion.  Subsequently, selective catheterization of
 the common hepatic artery was made using a 3-French microcatheter.  This
 depicted slow flow in the hepatic arterial circulation without evidence of

 55-year-old male with desaturation and concern for pulmonary embolism.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the chest were obtained
 without IV contrast using a low-dose expiratory technique followed by full
 dose images after a rapid bolus of 80 mL Optiray IV contrast per the chest
 pain protocol.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also obtained.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart and great vessels of
 the chest opacify well.  There is no evidence of aortic aneurysm, dissection
 or pulmonary embolism.  There is no pathologic mediastinal, hilar or axillary
 lymphadenopathy.  The patient is status post tracheobronchoplasty.  A
 small amount of soft tissue posterior to the trachea is likely postoperative
 edema.  There is consolidation of the dependent right upper lobe concerning
 for aspiration or pneumonia.  Also noted is patchy ground glass opacity of the
 left lung.  Unilateral interstitial thickening and smooth septal thickening on
 the right is consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Thickening and
 calcification of the posterior right pleura is compatible with prior talc
 pleurodesis.  There is no pneumothorax.

 Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates no significant
 abnormality.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Thoracotomy rib defects are present on the right. No suspicious
 lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are identifed.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pulmonary embolism.
 2.  Dependent consolidation of the right upper lobe is concerning for
 aspiration or pneumonia.  Patchy opacities of left lung may indicate
 multifocal involvement.
 3.  Asymmetric pulmonary edema of the right lung.

 AP CHEST, 6:31 A.M., [**2172-7-28**]
 HISTORY:  Vomiting while ventilated. Question aspiration.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-27**]:

 Mild interstitial edema has worsened.  There are no focal findings to suggest
 pneumonia or bronchial obstruction.  Heart size is normal.  Fullness in the
 mediastinum could be due to paratracheal adenopathy, but there is no mass
 effect, and findings could alternatively be due to a combination of fat
 deposition and vascular engorgement.

 ET tube is in standard placement, and nasogastric tube passes into the stomach
 and out of view.  I cannot tell whether a loop of tubing over the left
 supraclavicular region is vascular line.  Clinical assessment would be
 required, but if this is a vascular catheter, it does not ends centrally.

 COMPARISON:  CT torso of [**2119-6-19**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained following
 the administration of 75 cc of Optiray contrast IV, displayed at 5- and 1.25-
 mm collimation.  Coronal reformatted images were generated.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Multiple pleural masses within the left
 hemithorax and extending inferiorly from the left hemidiaphragm are slightly
 increased in size compared to the prior exam.  The mass within the left
 anterior diaphragmatic reflection has slightly increased, currently measuring
 10.3 x 4.3 cm in greatest axial dimensions (2:47), previously measuring 9.2 x
 4.0 cm.  The largest pleural lesion along the major fissure currently measures
 4.0 x 4.0 cm (2:26), previously measuring 3.7 x 3.4 cm.  No new lesions are
 identified.

 Lung windows demonstrate unchanged paramediastinal radiation fibrosis and
 traction bronchiectasis, particularly within the left upper chest.  No
 discrete pulmonary parenchymal nodules are seen.  The central airways remain
 patent to the subsegmental level bilaterally.

 There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Clips and soft tissue density
 within the anterior mediastinum are unchanged in configuration.  Heart and
 great vessels are unremarkable.  Left thyroid nodule is not significantly
 changed from the prior exam, measuring 1.2 x 1.1 cm (2:3).

 The exam is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.  Masses contiguous
 with the left hemidiaphragm representing metastatic thymoma appear slightly
 increased in size.  No focal liver lesions are seen, aside from focal fatty
 infiltration adjacent to the falciform ligament.

 Coronal reformatted images demonstrate persistent left hemidiaphragmatic
 elevation.

 There are no lytic or blastic lesions of the bones concerning for metastasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Abdomen, supine and upright film.

 INDICATION:  68-year-old female with a partial small-bowel obstruction and
 large parastomal hernia.  Assess interval change.

 COMPARISONS:  CT from [**2185-7-16**] and radiograph from [**2185-7-22**].

 FINDINGS:  The silhouette of an NG tube projects well below the diaphragm and
 is unchanged in position compared to the most recent examination.  The bowel
 gas pattern is overall unremarkable.  There are no air-fluid levels.  There
 are several dilated loops of small bowel within the left lower quadrant that
 are partially excluded on this radiograph.  This area correlates with the area
 of parastomal hernia visualized on the recent CT examination.  Barium is again
 noted and given its position likely is present within the small bowel.  There
 is overall no change in position of the barium compared to the most recent
 examination from [**2185-7-22**].  There are degenerative changes of the lower lumbar
 spine and slight spine scoliosis.  Several clips are also seen within the
 upper pelvis.

 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change compared to examination three days
 prior.  No air-fluid levels.  Persistent air-filled loops of small bowel
 within the region of the parastomal hernia, incompletely visualized on today's
 examination.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from [**2121-6-3**].

 The endotracheal tube is at the level of the clavicles.  Nasogastric tube side
 port is again at the gastroesophageal junction and could be advanced several
 centimeters for more optimal placement.  There is a right-sided central venous
 catheter with distal tip in the mid SVC.  There are persistent bilateral
 airspace opacities, left side worse than right, which are stable.  There is
 likely a left-sided pleural effusion.  Overall, the findings are unchanged.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Former 29-week premature infant, now 36 weeks corrected
 with persistent cardiac murmur.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison [**2112-5-12**].  The lungs are well aerated.  Hazy bilateral
 upper lobe opacity likely represents a component of atelectasis as well as
 perhaps mild chronic lung disease.  The heart size is normal.  The aortic arch
 appears to be on the left at the cardiac apex.  The feeding tube tip is in the
 proximal stomach.

 REASON:  Follow up carotid stenosis.

 FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
 There is heterogeneous plaque in the proximal ICA bilaterally.

 On the right peak velocities are 195, 89 and 88 cm/sec in the ICA, CCA and ECA
 respectively.  This is consistent with 60-69% stenosis.

 On the left peak velocities are 261, 80 and 154 cm/sec in the ICA, CCA and ECA
 respectively.  The ICA end-diastolic velocity is 52.  The ICA/CCA ratio is
 3.3.  This is consistent with 70-79% stenosis.

 There is antegrade vertebral flow bilaterally.

 IMPRESSION:  60-69% right ICA stenosis.  70-79% left ICA stenosis.  There has
 been no change since the prior study dated [**2123-1-11**].

                                 FINAL REPORT
 TWO-VIEW CHEST OF [**2122-4-12**] WITH INDICATION OF HYPOXIA.  RENAL FAILURE.

 Dual-lumen catheter is present with catheter tips terminating in the region of
 the proximal and mid superior vena cava.  Lung volumes are low, accentuating
 the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures.  Allowing for this
 factor, heart size is within normal limits.  Patchy and linear opacities are
 present in both lower lungs.  There are no pleural effusions.

 IMPRESSION:

 Low lung volumes.  Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis, but early
 basilar pneumonia is not excluded and followup radiographs may be helpful in
 this regard.  If clinical suspicion for infection persists, followup
 radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be helpful to fully exclude
 early basilar pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT

 RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
    507.0 uCi In-111 DTPA ([**2163-1-28**]);
 HISTORY: Burkitt lymphoma, HIV, CNS disease getting intrathecal chemotherapy,
 with new upper extremity weakness

 DECISION: Cisternogram

 INTERPRETATION: After the uneventful injection of Indium-111 DTPA tracer into
 the thecal sac at the level of the lumbar spine via lumbar puncture performed by
 the referring medical team, images of the head and spine were acquired 4, 24,
 48, and 72 hrs after tracer injection.  At 4 hours post injection, there is
 normal opacification of the entire thecal sac, concentrated in the lumbar area,
 but with some tracer also present in the basal cisterns.

 At 24 hours, tracer has evenly distributed and is present throughout the entire
 thecal sac and cisterns without evidence for blockage.  Note is made of relative
 [**Name (NI) 30303**] within the cervical spine, likely secondary to decreased CSF volume
 at this site, consistent with appearance on MR, but again, there is no
 obstruction to flow.  Tracer activity is normally decreased at 48 and 72 hours
 with relative [**Name (NI) 30303**] again noted about the cervical spine, but with an
 otherwise normal diffusion pattern.  Normal tracer activity is also present in
 the bladder.

 IMPRESSION: Relatively normal cisternogram with freely flowing CSF.  Relative
 area of decreased CSF volume in the cervical spine, but no occlusion or
 impediment to flow.

 PROCEDURE NAME:  PICC line placement.
 INDICATION: IV access needed for antibiotics.
 The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 44**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 412**] performed the procedure. Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 412**], the Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire
 procedure.

 TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the left brachial
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a single lumen PICC line measuring 49 cm in length was then
 placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under
 fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by a
 fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.
 The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The catheter was secured
 to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate
 complications.
 IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 4 French
 single-lumen PICC line placement via the left brachial venous approach. Final
 internal length is 49 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC. The line is ready to
 use.

 CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS ON [**1-10**]

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent intracranial hemorrhage.  Indwelling right NU stent
 secondary to prior staghorn calculus.  Recently placed G-tube.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helical acquisition CT images was performed from the lung bases
 through the ischial tuberosities following administration of oral contrast
 alone, per requesting physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 81973**] and sagittal reformats also
 provided.  No prior studies available for comparison.

 FINDINGS:
  Tiny bibasilar effusions and focus of nodular airspace disease in the left
 lower lobe, atelectasis versus pneumonia. Right lower lobe nodular ground-
 glass opacities are seen, the largest measuring 5 mm (2, 3).  The heart is
 markedly enlarged, and the intraventricular septum is dense suggesting
 underlying anemia.

 Non-contrast evaluation of the liver, spleen and pancreas reveals no
 abnormalities.  There is no biliary dilatation or significant ascites. Adrenal
 glands are unremarkable.  Dense atherosclerotic calcifications of the
 aortoiliac system without aneurysmal dilatation.  The IVC is decompressed,
 likely reflecting underlying hypovolemia.  There are small retroperitoneal
 lymph nodes in a paraaortic location.

 There are small locules of free air in a subdiaphragmatic location, likely due
 to recent placement of a G-tube.  The tube does currently appear within the
 gastric body.

 There are changes of chronic hydronephrosis and cortical atrophy with multiple
 cysts, some thick-walled seen within the right kidney. There are dystrophic
 calcifications as well as a coarse, possibly parenchymal calculus measuring
 approximately 7 mm seen in the right upper pole.  There is an indwelling
 nephroureteral stent, the proximal tip of which is within the renal pelvis,
 the distal tip of which is in the base of the bladder.  There is a Foley
 catheter within the bladder within which there is a small amount of gas.

 Left kidney is atrophic, also with multiple cysts and an extrarenal pelvis.
 There are dystrophic calcifications surrounding the left kidney as well.  No

 (Cont)
 definite hydronephrosis is seen. There is no left- sided stent. Changes from
 prior bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes noted.

 Small bowel loops are unremarkable.  Contrast passes to the rectum unimpeded.
 There is a focal short segment of sigmoid colonic wall thickening (2, 60-65)
 which may be infectious or inflammatory in origin.  Ischemic bowel should also
 be considered.  There is minimal surrounding stranding of the mesentery.  No
 free fluid in the deep pelvis.  No abnormal mass or lymphadenopathy.

 Review of bone windows demonstrates no focal lesions.  There are mild
 degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Intraperitoneal free air, likely on the basis of recent G-tube placement.

 2.  Focal short segment sigmoid colon wall thickening. Infectious/inflammatory
 and ischemic etiologies should be considered.  A followup CT or colonoscopy is
 advised when clinically able, to rule out the possibility of underlying
 neoplastic process.

 3.  Atrophic left kidney with multiple cysts.  Chronically obstructive right
 kidney with dilated calices and multiple cysts and an indwelling
 nephroureteral stent, appropriately positioned.  A contrast-enhanced
 examination could further evaluate the residual function, as could a nuclear
 scan as clinically warranted. Comparison with ptiot studies advised, to
 exclude solid renal mass.

 4.  Focal airspace disease, left lower lobe, atelectasis versus pneumonia.

 5.  Two 5-mm right lower lobe nodule. Follow-up in 6 months advised.

 6.  Cardiomegaly and likely anemia.

 Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

 and continued oozing.  Please assess surgical site for seroma versus abscess.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison made to [**2139-7-2**] ultrasound.

 Focused ultrasound scanning was performed in the left lower extremity over the
 patient's known fluid collections in the left thigh and left groin.

 Between the patient's two suture sites in the left lateral thigh is an ovoid
 fluid collection measuring 3.7 x 1.1 x 1.5 cm, which contains some
 heterogeneous internal echogenicity most consistent with hematoma.  Color
 Doppler evaluation demonstrates no internal flow within this collection.

 Left inguinal collection is similar in appearance, measuring 4.0 x 1.6 x 3.1
 cm, with heterogeneous internal echogenicity, also most consistent with
 hematoma.  Note is also made of several prominent lymph nodes in the left
 groin.

 IMPRESSION:  Two fluid collections in the left lower extremity, one overlying
 the left thigh laterally, and second in the left groin, with son[**Name (NI) 110**]
 features most consistent with hematoma.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post subdural hematoma evacuation.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.

 FINDINGS:  Today's examination is compared to the prior from [**2132-6-9**]. As
 before, there has been evacuation of the left subdural hematoma with small
 amounts of blood remaining along the tentorium and falx.  The degree of
 pneumocephalus has slightly improved.

 The focal hypodensity in the left frontal lobe has somewhat increased in size
 but the intraparenchymal hematoma is unchanged.  An additional focus of low
 attenuation has developed in the parafalcine left frontal lobe on series 2
 images 21 through at least 24. Again these findings could represent delayed
 hemorrhagic contusions or acute infarcts that had developed in the left
 anterior cerebral artery territory. If these do represent infarcts, they
 could be either arterial or venous in origin.

 There continues to be rightward midline shift of an unchanged amount. The
 lacune within the left thalamus is unchanged. There has been no change in the
 remainder of the examination.

 The right frontal subgaleal hematoma is unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:  The left frontal hypodensity has slightly increased in size.  The
 intraparenchymal hemorrhage has not changed.

 An additional area of hypodensity is also developed in the parafalcine frontal
 lobe.

 The combination of these findings could relate to an infarct.  Consideration
 should be given to the possibility of superficial venous infarcts.

 Alternatively, these could represent contusions.  The degree of midline shift
 is unchanged.  Tiny amounts of residual subdural hematoma remain over the left
 frontoparietal convexity as well as along the falx and tentorium.

 The remainder of the exam is unchanged.

 AP CHEST, 4:59 A.M., [**6-5**]

 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and respiratory failure.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-2**] through 11:

 The improvement in multifocal consolidation between [**6-2**] and 10 suggests
 that a large component at that time was due to pulmonary edema, and subsequent
 worsening is probably due mainly to worsening of pulmonary edema, but no focal
 consolidation in the left mid and right lower lung zones is probably
 pneumonia.  Heart size is top normal.  Pleural effusion is probably moderate,
 on the left, indeterminate on the right.  No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal
 vascular congestion persists.  Right jugular line tip projects over the mid
 SVC, ET tube ends at the sternal notch and a nasogastric tube passes below the
 diaphragm and out of view.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  32-year-old male with malpositioned PICC.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 769**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 65**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**],
 the attending radiologist, supervised.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A preprocedure timeout was performed using two
 patient identifiers.  The patient's left arm was prepped and draped in the
 usual sterile fashion.  The previously placed PICC in the left arm was noted
 to be malpositioned with termination in the left axillary vein.  A 0.018-inch
 guidewire was then inserted through the previously placed PICC and advanced
 into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The old PICC was exchanged for a
 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.  A new dual-lumen PICC was trimmed to
 appropriate length of 45 cm and advanced over the wire to a termination in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guide wire were
 removed.  The PICC was flushed, capped and secured to the skin with a sterile
 dressing.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful PICC exchange over a wire with new dual-lumen 45 cm
 PICC terminating in the SVC.  The line is now ready for use.

 pneumonia.  Heart size is top normal though increased since [**7-7**].  Tip of
 the right PIC catheter projects over the upper SVC.  New tubing projects over
 the upper abdomen but cannot be localized on this view alone.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23909**] and I
 discussed these findings by telephone at the time of dictation.

 CT CERVICAL SPINE

 HISTORY:  73-year-old man with quadriparesis following a fall, noted to have a
 high-grade canal stenosis of the cervical spine, status post ACDF of C4/5,
 here for postop evaluation.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the cervical spine was performed extending from the skull
 base to the T2 level with 2.5 mm axial and 2 mm coronal and sagittal
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the preoperative studies from [**2123-10-8**].

 There is a new anterior fixation plate with two screws through the bodies of
 C4 and C5.  An intervertebral bone graft is seen within the disc space as well
 as small bubbles of air.  There is no evidence of hardware breaks. The screws
 are well placed within the vertebral bodies.  The anterior plate is well
 apposed to the vertebral bodies.

 There has been partial resection of the posterior corners of the vertebral
 bodies adjacent to the C4/5 disc.  The previously seen posterior osteophytes
 have been largely resected with some minimal osteophytes remaining at the
 uncovertebral joints bilaterally.

 The evaluation of the intraspinal contents is somewhat limited due to streak
 artifacts from the orthopedic hardware.  Bilateral foraminal stenoses are
 again seen at this level.

 Again seen is a non-displaced corner fracture of the anteroinferior corner of
 C3.

 Multilevel degenerative changes are again seen as before.

 There is new soft tissue emphysema of the anterior neck, especially extending
 along the right side of the neck and along the esophagus.

 The visualized lung apices are clear.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Since [**2123-10-8**], new ACDF of C4 and C5 with no evidence of hardware breaks.
 The previously seen posterior disc osteophyte complex has been resected with
 residual osteophytes of the uncovertebral joints bilaterally remaining.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 LIVER ULTRASOUND:

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Hepatitis C, derived cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease,
 diabetes to evaluate for PV thrombosis and look for ascites.

 The liver is small and coarse in echotexture, compatible with the known
 cirrhosis.  The spleen is moderately enlarged at 14 cm in length.  There are
 some linear calcifications within the spleen probably representing arterial
 calcifications related to the patient's underlying diabetes.  There is no
 evidence of ascites and no focal liver lesions are seen.

 Both kidneys are small and show scattered calcifications but no
 hydronephrosis.  The patient is known to have end-stage renal dysfunction.

 The portal vein is patent with forward flow and a velocity of 47 cm/sec.  The
 right, middle and left hepatic veins are patent with normal flow dynamics. The
 left portal vein is visualized and forward flowing.  Limited views of the
 splenic/superior mesenteric vein junction were also fully patent.  More
 distally, these vessels could not be imaged due to gas.

 CONCLUSION:  Cirrhosis with splenomegaly but no focal liver lesions, no
 ascites and patent portal and hepatic venous systems.

 abscess, pyelonephritis, fistula.

 COMPARISONS:  Ultrasound [**2120-12-30**] and ERCP report.

 TECHNIQUE:  Following the administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenous
 contrast, MDCT axial images were acquired from the lung bases to the pubic
 symphysis.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were then obtained.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  No areas of consolidation.  The liver,
 spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and abdominal portions of the large
 and small bowel appear unremarkable.  The gallbladder is moderately distended
 and a small amount of pericholecystic fluid is noted.  Multiple
 hyperattenuating foci are present within the gallbladder neck and consistent
 in appearance with small gallstones.  A biliary stent terminates within the
 second portion of the duodenum.  There is marked fat stranding around the head
 of the pancreas which appears new compared to previous examinations.  There is
 no free fluid or free air within the abdomen.  No pathologically enlarged
 mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are present.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Note is made of bilateral fat-containing
 femoral hernias.  A Foley balloon is present in a collapsed bladder.  A small
 amount of air noted non-dependently.  The patient is status post total
 colectomy with ileostomy noted in the right lower quadrant.  No evidence of
 peri-bowel abscesses or fistulae.  There is no free fluid within the pelvis.
 No pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes are noted.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Mild peripancreatic inflammatory change corresponding by imaging with mild
 acute pancreatitis.

 2.  Moderately distended gallbladder with wall edema and pericholecystic fluid
 in addition to multiple small stones present within the neck relatively
 unchanged in appearance compared to the ultrasound from one day prior.  Status

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever in a patient with known biliary sepsis.

 Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2145-3-17**].

 The ET tube tip is 4.3 cm above the carina.  The right subclavian line tip is
 in mid SVC.  The NG tube passes below the diaphragm most likely terminating in
 the stomach although its tip is below the inferior margin of the film.

 Minimal interval improvement in pulmonary edema is noted with unchanged left
 retrocardiac atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions.  Borderline
 cardiomegaly is stable.

 IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in pulmonary edema still accompanied by large
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Left retrocardiac atelectasis.

 Most likely underlying emphysema.

 ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND

 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplantation with recurrent HCV / cirrhosis
 now with acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease, no nephrolithiasis
 query renal obstruction, evaluate for ascites.

 COMPARISON:  [**2158-9-28**].

 FINDINGS:  [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 64**] images demonstrate that
 the liver is of essentially normal contour but demonstrates new coarse,
 heterogeneous echogenicity.  No focal parenchymal liver masses are
 demonstrated.  The left portal vein demonstrates new bidirectional flow; the
 main portal and right anterior portal vein appear normal.  Flow is normal in
 the right hepatic artery and hepatic vein.  Small bilateral non-obstructing
 renal calculi without hydronephrosis are again seen, one in the mid-polar
 region of the right kidney measuring 7.6 mm and one in the left mid-polar
 region measuring 1 cm.  The right kidney measures 11.5 cm pole to pole and the
 left 11.3 cm.  The spleen is of normal contour and echotexture and measures
 11.4 cm.  Trace ascites is seen.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No son[**Name (NI) 64**] evidence for renal obstruction: persistent small
 nonobstructing bilateral renal calculi.

 2.  Trace ascites and too small for drainage.

 3. Increased heptic heterogeneous echogenicity and bidirectional flow in the
 portal vein suggests possible cirrhosis and developing portal hypertension.

 HISTORY:  Recent onset of odynophagia, recurrent pneumonias.  Evaluate for
 signs of aspiration.

 No priors available.

 VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW STUDY

 This study was performed in conjunction with the speech pathology department.
 Multiple consistencies of liquid barium and solids coated with barium were
 administered to the patient under continuous fluoroscopic observation.  This
 patient demonstrated mild oropharyngeal phase dysfunction with decreased
 tongue propulsion and swallow initiation.  The pharyngeal phase was markedly
 abnormal, demonstrating episodes of both penetration and aspiration with thin
 liquid consistency, which was nonresponsive to a chin tuck maneuver.  An
 appropriate cough reflux was noted, however, was not effective in clearing
 aspirated material and there was difficulty in coordinating the epiglottic
 deflection with the swallow initiation.  Mild-to-moderate amount of residue
 was noted with thin and nectar consistencies in the piriform sinuses and
 valleculae and there is evidence of early premature spillover with thin liquid
 consistencies.

 IMPRESSION:

 Laryngeal penetration and aspiration with thin liquid consistency not
 responsive to chin tuck maneuver.

 Please note that a barium swallow was subsequently attempted, however, the
 patient was too dyspneic to allow the procedure to be performed.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Severe diabetes complicated by gastroparesis and end-stage renal
 disease on hemodialysis, now with facial swelling and recurrent coag-negative
 staph bacteremia.  Please evaluate subclavian, internal jugular and
 brachiocephalic veins for stenosis or thrombosis.

 COMPARISON:  No prior MRI.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired through the
 lower neck and upper chest without gadolinium due to renal insufficiency.
 Nongated and gated FIESTA images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular venous access catheter is in place.  There
 is severe stenosis of the right internal jugular vein about the catheter, with
 no flow visualized around the catheter, to the level of its junction with the
 brachiocephalic vein. The right brachiocephalic vein is patent with a couple
 of areas of linear low signal intensity on sagittal time-of-flight images that
 could represent flow disturbance due to valves.  The cephalad aspect of the
 superior vena cava is widely patent. However, there is a filling defect about
 the tip of the right internal jugular catheter at the junction of the
 SVC/right atrium which is subocclusive with a thin peripheral rim of flow
 within the lower SVC (6:34; 3:36).  While this filling defect likely extends
 into the upper right atrium (10:16), the entire extent is difficult to assess.
 The left internal jugular vein is patent (7:6), but diminutive in size and
 difficult to assess just proximal to its insertion at the brachiocephalic vein
 (3:23; 7:13 as representative images). The left brachiocephalic vein is
 patent.

 The imaged portion of the heart and pericardium appear within normal limits on
 this examination which is not targeted for evaluation of these structures. The
 marrow signal appears unremarkable.  Limited images of the liver, spleen,
 adrenal glands, and upper poles of the kidneys appear unremarkable.  Note is
 made of gastric distention.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Right internal jugular venous access catheter in place with stenosis of
 the right internal jugular vein about the catheter to the insertion with the

 2.  Subocclusive fibrin sheath or thrombus about the tip of the right internal
 jugular venous access catheter in the distal SVC and probably upper right
 atrium.  The patient is scheduled to undergo transthoracic echocardiography
 later on the date of dictation and further evaluation for the size of the
 thrombus or fibrin collection is recommended at this time.

 3.  Diminutive but probably patent internal jugular vein.  This could be
 further assessed with ultrasound if clinically indicated.

 4.  Gastric distention concordant with a given history of diabetic
 gastroparesis.

 The results were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35613**] at 10:00 a.m. on [**2187-6-26**].

 Rightward mediastinal shift and left lower lobe collapse persists.  Right
 upper lobe consolidation, which increased from [**4-12**] to [**5-26**], probably
 region of mass and post-obstructive atelectasis, is partially obscured by EKG
 lead.  Moderate-to-large cardiac silhouette which also increased over that
 period of time is subsequently stable, suggesting pericardial effusion.  Right
 subclavian line ends at the superior cavoatrial junction.  No right
 pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  46-year-old man with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain status
 post liver transplant.

 COMPARISONS:  CTA of the abdomen dated [**2175-4-6**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the abdomen were obtained with oral contrast and
 both without and with nonionic intravenous Optiray contrast in the arterial,
 portal venous, and delayed phases of enhancement.  Delayed images through the
 pelvis were also obtained with intravenous and oral contrast in the delayed
 phase.  Sagittal, coronal, and volume-rendered reformations were essential to
 interpretation.

 ABDOMEN:  Bilateral gynecomastia is present.  There has been a decrease in the
 right pleural effusion, which is now small, with the attenuation of simple
 fluid.  Adjacent atelectasis is mild.  A small amount of pericardial fluid is
 new.  A jejunal feeding tube is present.

 The intraparenchymal hepatic collection has slightly increased in size,
 measuring 13.3 x 8.2 cm (3, 27), compared to 12.2 x 6.7 cm.  Overall, it is
 more hypoattenuating but contains new air locules.  Relative hypoattenuation
 of the surrounding hepatic parenchyma in segments VIII, V, and IV is more
 conspicuous and suggests hypoperfusion.

 There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Linear hypoattenuation in
 segment VI of the liver is unchanged, and may be related to prior catheter
 tract. A collection at the falciform ligament is smaller, measuring 4.6 x 3.9
 cm (3B, 153), compared to 5.1 x 5.0 cm on the prior study.  It contains
 intermediate attenuation material, with air.  The pigtail catheter has been
 removed.  There has been interval near complete resolution of the fluid
 collection along the left posterior hepatic margin, with trace fluid now
 measuring only 9 mm in thickness.

 The spleen remains enlarged, measuring 16.4 cm.  A splenule is noted.  The

 (Cont)
 perisplenic hematoma appears slightly more hypoattenuating, compatible with
 evolution.  It is stable in size.  Tiny collections anterior to the spleen may
 represent additional small hematomas.  They demonstrate wall enhancement, but
 no air.

 The pancreas is atrophic.  The adrenal glands and kidneys are within normal
 limits.  There is no bowel dilatation.  There are no pathologically enlarged
 lymph nodes.  Splenic varices and a splenorenal shunt are unchanged.

 There is a new collection in the left anterior pericolic region where free
 fluid was previously seen.  It measures up to 5.8 x 3.0 cm (6, 40) in greatest
 axial dimensions and appears slightly internally heterogeneous.  It contains
 no air.

 PELVIS:  A fluid collection along the right pelvic side wall with wall
 enhancement but no air appears similar when compared to [**2175-3-24**].  It measures
 6.0 x 2.5 cm (6, 71).  The rectum is unremarkable.  The sigmoid colon is
 collapsed.  The distal ureters, bladder, seminal vesicles, and prostate gland
 are within normal limits.

 CTA:  The hepatic arterial vessels are patent.  The right and left hepatic
 veins remain patent, with truncation of the middle hepatic vein at the margin
 of the hematoma.  The right and left portal veins are patent, but splayed by
 the hematoma, and there is similar mild mass effect upon the right portal vein
 by the hematoma.  There is no evidence of active arterial extravasation.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are no suspicious lesions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight interval increase in intrahepatic hematoma.  New air bubbles are
 worrisome for superinfection.
 2.  Interval decrease in a simple right pleural effusion.
 3.  Evolution of a perisplenic hematoma.
 4.  Slight interval decrease in the falciform ligament air-containing
 collection, worrisome for abscess.  The pigtail catheter has been removed in
 the interim.  The left perihepatic collection has nearly resolved.
 5.  Two additional collections in the left paracolic gutter and right pelvis
 may represent hematoma.  However, attention is recommended on followup
 imaging.

 COMPARISON:  [**2125-6-28**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted and axial T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR,
 gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted images of the brain were obtained.
 Following intravenous gadolinium administration, multiplanar T1-weighted
 images of the brain were obtained.

 FINDINGS:  Contrast-enhanced images are somewhat limited by patient motion.
 There are no enhancing parenchymal or meningeal lesions to suggest metastatic
 disease.  Diffuse atrophy of the brain parenchyma is again noted, unchanged.
 There are multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical and deep
 white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, as well as adjacent to the atrium
 of the left lateral ventricle.  They are unchanged and consistent with chronic
 small vessel ischemic disease.  There is no evidence of mass effect, blood
 products, or a large infarction in the brain parenchyma. The major vascular
 flow voids appear unremarkable.

 There is moderate mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus.  There is
 mild mucosal thickening in the right frontal and bilateral anterior ethmoid
 sinuses.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of metastatic disease.
 2.  Unchanged diffuse cerebral atrophy and chronic small vessel ischemic
 disease.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cholangiocarcinoma with new rectal incontinence, concern for
 spread of disease.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet including dynamic 3D imaging obtained prior to, during, and after
 the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of 20 mL of
 gadolinium-DTPA.  In addition, 1 mg of glucagon was administered IM prior to
 imaging.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated on an
 independent workstation.

 MR PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum and visualized sigmoid appears normal.
 The external and internal sphincters, anal sling, and pelvic floor are within
 normal limits without evidence for abnormal thickening or enhancement to
 suggest metastatic spread.  There is trace fluid within the pelvis.  The
 bladder, prostate, and visualized bowel loops appear normal. There is abnormal
 low signal within both seminal vesicles, but no evidence for architectural
 distortion or asymmetry.  The patient is status post bilateral total hip
 arthroplasties.  No suspicious lesions are identified in the visualized
 osseous structures though note is made of multilevel degenerative changes,
 most significant at the L5-S1 level.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No evidence for metastatic disease in the rectum, anus, or associated
 musculature.

 2.  Trace free fluid in the pelvis, potentially related to known peritoneal
 disease.

 HISTORY:  46-year-old female with pulmonary fibrosis and cardiomyopathy, now
 presenting with tachycardia, back pain, and exertional dyspnea, to rule out
 pulmonary embolism.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest was performed without intravenous contrast
 followed by CT of the chest post administration of intravenous contrast;
 reconstructions were performed in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes.

 COMPARISON:  With examination of [**2128-4-9**].

 CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

 There is no pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.  The coronary arteries
 arise from the normal expected anatomical location.  There is a tracheal
 catheter seen in situ via a tracheostomy.  There is overall stable appearance
 to the chronic changes including bilateral pleural thickening and
 predominantly upper lobe scarring and bronchiectasis. The previously seen
 myceatoma in the left upper lobe is no longer seen on todays scan.

 There is cardiomegaly with mild enlargement of the main pulmonary artery,
 unchanged since the prior examination.  There is no significant intrathoracic
 or axillary lymphadenopathy.

 The visualized liver and spleen appear unremarkable.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL:

 There is a healed fracture through one of the left lower ribs.

 CONCLUSION:

 1.  No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.  The coronary arteries arise
 from the normal expected anatomical location.

 2.  Chronic pulmonary fibrosis as described above in predominately
 subpleural location, unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 MR CERVICAL AND THORACIC SPINE

 HISTORY:  51-year-old man with history of Down's syndrome with two days of
 decrease total body tone with flaccid arms.

 MR CERVICAL SPINE:

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1, T2, STIR and axial GRE images of the cervical spine
 were obtained.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to a CT of the cervical spine from [**2108-7-5**].

 The visualized brainstem is normal in signal intensity.  There is T2
 hyperintensity of the cord extending from the C3 to the C5 level with thinning
 of the cord consistent with myelomalacia.  There is also tiny areas of
 susceptibility within the ventral cord especially at the C5 level suggestive
 of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

 At C2/3, there is thickening of the posterior longitudinal ligament, disc
 osteophyte complex and ligamentum flavum thickening, the combination of which
 is causing mild canal stenosis and bilateral foraminal stenoses.

 At C3/4, there is thickening of the ligamentum flavum and the PLL as well as
 the disc osteophyte complex causing severe canal stenosis and moderate
 bilateral foraminal stenoses.

 At C4/5, there is thickening of the PLL, ligamentum flavum as well as disc
 osteophyte complex and facet arthropathy, the combination of which is causing
 severe canal stenosis and moderate-to-severe bilateral foraminal stenoses.
 There is bone marrow edema of the C4 and C5 vertebral bodies as well as the
 left facet joints.

 At C5/6, there is minimal anterior spondylolisthesis of C5 and C6.  There is
 again thickening of the PLL on the ligamentum flavum as well as disc bulge and
 facet arthropathy, the combination of which is causing moderate canal stenosis
 and bilateral moderate foraminal stenoses.  There is bone marrow edema the
 adjacent vertebral bodies.

                                                             (Over)

 At C6/7, there is thickening of the ligamentum flavum and PLL with disc
 osteophyte complex causing mild canal stenosis and bilateral foraminal
 stenosis.  There is bone marrow edema the adjacent vertebral bodies.

 At C7/T1, there is disc osteophyte complex and ligamentum flavum thickening
 causing mild canal stenosis and bilateral foraminal stenoses.

 There is a laryngeal intubation.

 MR THORACIC SPINE:

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1, T2, STIR and axial T2-weighted images of the thoracic
 spine were obtained.

 FINDINGS:  The thoracic cord shows minimal T2 hyperintensity at the T10/11
 level suggestive of mild edema.  The conus medullaris is not definitively seen
 and extends past the T12/L1 level.

 At T1/2,  there is a mild disc bulge but without canal or foraminal stenosis.

 There is bone marrow edema at the T9/10 level, with adjacent Schmorl's nodes
 and a mild disc bulge but without canal or foraminal stenosis.

 At the T10/11 level, there is minimal bone marrow edema as well as a disc
 bulge and thickening of the ligamentum flavum, the combination of which is
 causing moderate canal stenosis and bilateral foraminal stenosis.

 There is a mild compression fracture of T12 with bone marrow edema as well as
 multiple Schmorl's nodes of both the inferior and superior endplates.

 At the T12/L1 level, there is a mild disc bulge but without canal or foraminal
 stenosis.  Minimal bone marrow edema of the inferior endplate of L1 is seen
 with a small Schmorl's node.

 Multiple stones are seen within the gallbladder.  There are intermediate
 signal intensity within the visualized lung bases, which may represent
 atelectasis or consolidation.  Recommend correlation with chest x-ray.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Multilevel canal stenosis of the cervical spine worst at the C3/4 and C4/5
 levels where there are severe canal stenosis with compression of the cord.
 There is myelomalacia of the cord extending from the C2 to the C5 levels with
 small areas of hemorrhage within the ventral cord.

 2.  Degenerative changes causing moderate canal stenosis at the T10/11 level

 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): JXXb WED [**2139-10-28**] 7:09 PM
  Percutaneous cholangiogram demonstrated no bile leak at the anastomosis of
  hepatojejunostomy, mild dilation of common bile duct observed, and no dilation
  of intrahepatic duct.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  The patient is a 55-year-old male with possible bile
 leak from hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis.  A request was made to perform a
 percutaneous cholangiogram to evaluate the anastomosis.

 OPERATORS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1759**] [**Name (STitle) 1760**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1622**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1163**], the attending radiologist
 who was present and supervised during the whole procedure.

 FLUOROSCOPIC TIME:  4 minutes 44 seconds.

 PROCEDURE:  Percutaneous cholangiogram.

 ANESTHESIA:  General anesthesia was applied.  Lidocaine was used for local
 anesthesia.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After risks, benefits, and alternatives for the
 proposed procedure were thoroughly explained to the patient, informed consent
 was obtained.  The patient was taken to the angiographic suite and placed
 supine on the imaging table.  A pre-procedure timeout was performed.  General
 endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The abdomen was prepared and draped in
 the usual sterile fashion.  Using a Chiba needle, and under fluoroscopic
 monitoring, the needle was advanced via the patient's right abdomen at the
 level of the mid-axillary line towards the liver hilum.  Contrast was then
 injected through the needle as it was rejected.  Once the biliary system was
 identified, contrast was instilled and a percutaneous cholangiogram was
 performed. There was no dilation of intrahepatic ducts, and mild dilation of
 the common bile duct was noticed.  The lower end of the common hepatic duct
 was anastomosed to the jejunum side by side.  Contrast flowed freely into and
 through the jejunum. There was no leaking of contrast noticed. A series of
 fluoroscopic images were taken, following the passage of the contrast inside
 the jejunum, and no contrast leak was identified.

 After discussion with the surgeon who had performed the surgery, a decision
 was made to just perform a percutaneous cholangiogram and drainage catheter
                                                             (Over)

 EXAM:  MR of the brain.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with intraventricular hemorrhage, for
 resolution assessment.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images
 of the brain were acquired.  Correlation was made with the head CT examination
 of [**2180-11-17**].

 FINDINGS:  There is an area of hyperintensity seen in relation with the right
 choroid plexus, indicating blood products in relation with the choroid plexus.
 Compared to the prior study and accounting for differences in techniques,
 there has been interval resolution of the degree of intraventricular
 hemorrhage.  Subtle areas of low signal indicating chronic blood products are
 seen in the subependymal region of right ventricular atrium.  There are no
 fluid-fluid levels identified within the ventricle.  There is mild-to-moderate
 enlargement of lateral ventricles including prominence of temporal horns
 indicating ventriculomegaly which is unchanged from previous study.  Mild
 brain atrophy is identified as before.  There are soft tissue changes with
 fluid within the left mastoid air cells.  Partially visualized nasopharynx
 demonstrates no evidence of asymmetry.  There is no acute infarct on diffusion
 images.  Mild changes of small vessel disease are seen in the white matter.

 IMPRESSION:

 Right-sided choroid plexus and subependymal hemorrhage in the atrium of the
 right lateral ventricle which has evolved since the previous CT examination of
 [**2180-11-17**].  No new hemorrhage identified.  Moderate ventriculomegaly is again
 seen.  Small vessel disease is noted.  No evidence of periventricular edema.
 No acute infarcts.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:18 A.M., [**10-26**]

 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease, tracheostomy tube.  Sepsis, possible
 pneumonia.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2187-10-25**].  Lungs are grossly
 abnormal.  Heavy reticulation throughout could be due to pulmonary fibrosis or
 edema superimposed on emphysema.  Focal opacification in the right upper lobe,
 the left lower lobe may represent pneumonia.  Bilateral hilar retraction
 indicates severe upper lobe scarring.  Heart is top normal size.  Pleural
 effusions if any are small on the right, small-to-moderate on the left.
 Tracheostomy tube and right supraclavicular dual-channel central venous
 dialysis catheter, and the tip of a percutaneous gastrostomy are in standard
 placements as far as one can tell on a single frontal view.  Heavy
 calcification projecting over the diaphragmatic surface of the heart could be
 pericardial or pleural.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  abdominal pain and persistent hypotension.  Rule out aortic
 dissection.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple studies, the most recent dated [**2143-11-21**] at
 [**Location (un) 1291**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images through the chest, abdomen and pelvis before and
 after the administration of intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformatted views were displayed.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The central airways are patent to the
 segmental levels, bilaterally.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Severe emphysema is again noted.  Bilateral opacities in the dependent
 portions of the lung bases may represent atelectasis versus consolidation. The
 heart is normal in size. There is no pleural effusion. Coronary calcifications
 are seen. There is no mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Enlarged right hilar lymph
 node is seen. No axillary lymphadenopathy is present.

 Noncalcified lung nodules are seen in the right upper lobe measuring 5 mm,
 right middle lobe measuring 3 mm, left upper lobe measuring 4 mm and lingula
 measuring 4 mm (S3, I26, 33, 46, 52).  When compared to the prior study dated
 [**2143-2-18**], there has been no significant interval change in the size and
 appearence of the nodules. No new nodules are identified.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, and
 adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The pancreas is mildly atrophic.  The right
 kidney is unremarkable.  The left kidney demonstrates multiple cysts, the
 largest one in the lower pole measuring 5.3 x 4.1 cm.  There is no free air or
 free fluid within the abdomen.  No mesenteric or retroperitoneal
 lymphadenopathy is seen.  The intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are
 unremarkable.  The colon is mildly distended with air-fluid levels.  There is
 no pneumatosis or bowel wall edema.

 CTA:  Atherosclerotic changes of the aorta are seen without evidence of
 dissection.  The celiac, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) **], and renal arteries are patent.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study obtained on [**2130-11-16**]
 at 6:52 p.m.

 No appreciable change in cardiomediastinal contour is demonstrated.  The lungs
 are essentially clear with minimal perihilar interstitial opacities not
 prominent enough to suggest pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax seen.  The right lower lobe nodule seen on [**2130-10-29**]
 examination is not seen on the current study.  That might be due to exam
 technique and does not necessarily state the resolution of the nodule.

 PICC LINE PLACEMENT

 INDICATION:  IV access needed for medication.

 The procedure was explained to the patient.  A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 30109**] [**Name (STitle) 30110**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 22981**] [**Name (STitle) 29638**], the attending
 radiologist who was present and supervised during the whole procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right basilic
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen reverse-tip PICC line measuring 45 cm in
 length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in
 the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  Position of the catheter was confirmed
 by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guidwire were then removed.  The catheter was secured
 to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 5 French
 double-lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic venous approach.  Final
 internal length is 45 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC.  The line is ready
 to use.

  locules of air are noted within the posterior mediastinal fluid collection,
  which may also suggest superinfection/leak, although air locules may have also
  entered into the mediastinal from previous bilateral pneumothoraces.  Interval
  development of a loculated moderate right pleural effusion with simple
  Hounsfield units (non-chylus).  Interval development of multifocal pneumonia.
  Diffuse anasarca and moderate hydrocele.  Small nonocclusive thrombosis/fibrin
  sheath distal to the SVC central line.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophagectomy for esophageal cancer complicated by chylothorax now
 with increasing sepsis.

 Comparison is made to most recent CT torso dated [**2162-8-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest,
 abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast injected through the J-
 tube.  Residual barium from prior enema is also noted within the large bowel.
 Coronal and sagittal reformations were evaluated.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There has been interval
 development of multifocal opacities within the lungs in addition to interval
 increase in right-sided loculated simple effusion with a small air component
 noted posteromedially (2:40).  Adjacent compression atelectasis is present
 within the right lower lobe. Small left effusion persists with adjacent
 compression atelectasis.  No pathologically enlarged axillary or mediastinal
 lymph nodes are identified.  Air and fluid is noted within the neoesophagus
 with a few scattered locules of air noted within the fluid collection medial
 to the distal neoesophagus, posterior to the left atrium (2:39), which was not
 present on prior exam.  Atherosclerotic disease is stable.  A small
 nonocclusive thrombus is noted just distal to the tip of the right central
 venous catheter terminating within the mid-to-lower SVC.  A right-sided chest
 tube remains in position.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST:  Please note overall
 examination is limited due to a large amount of streak artifact from
 hyperdense barium which remains within the colon.  Contrast-enhanced images of
 the liver, gallbladder, which remains mildly distended, spleen, pancreas,
 kidneys, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  No pathologically enlarged

 lymph nodes are noted within the abdominal cavity.  An open surgical wound and
 extending towards the anterior abdominal wall is noted within the upper
 midline abdomen just inferior to the sternal tip

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST:  There has been
 significant interval worsening in the amount of free fluid within the lower
 abdomen and pelvic cavity which now displays rim enhancement and multiple
 locules of air within it.  The overall size of the collection is difficult to
 estimate given its extension towards the left paracolic gutter.  It is
 approximately 10 x 18 x 18 cm.  No pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes
 are identified.  Air is noted within a Foley containing urinary bladder with
 the tip of the Foley abutting the superior aspect of the bladder causing
 slight contour deformity.  Marked anasarca is noted within the subcutaneous
 tissues with a moderate hydrocele noted within the visualized scrotum.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Left humeral head bone island is stable with no malignant-
 appearing osseous lesions identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of large intraabdominal/intrapelvic air-containing
 rim-enhancing fluid collection most suggestive of a large abscess.  No
 definite evidence of oral contrast extravasation within this fluid collection
 to suggest a bowel leak, although the overall exam is limited due to a large
 amount of streak artifact from the residual barium within the colon.

 2.  Interval development of air locules within the posterior mediastinal fluid
 posterior to the left atrium. Unclear if this also represents superinfection
 versus air locules that are dissected from the previous pneumothoraces, or
 less likely esophageal leak. Right hydropneumothorax (small residual
 pneumothorax is noted posteromedially, moderate- sized loculated simple right
 pleural effusion).

 3.  Diffuse anasarca and moderate sized hydrocele.

 4.  New multifocal pneumonia.

 5.  Small nonocclusive thrombus within the distal SVC likely related to a
 fibrin sheath/catheter related thrombosis.

 Above findings were discussed with caring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 22928**] shortly after

 with tip terminating within the jejunum. Additionally, there appears to be
 invagination of the pylorus into the stomach more proximally, with a thin
 stripe of fat surrounding the balloon from the gastrostomy tube.  This may be
 causing gastric outlet obstruction as the stomach is distended and fluid-
 filled, with the distal esophagus fluid-filled to the level of the thoracic
 inlet.  There is a moderate amount of free intraperitoneal air, predominantly
 centered anterior to the liver, as well as locules inferiorly in the mid
 abdomen.  This could be related to recent gastrostomy tube placement.

 Non-contrast liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, and pancreas
 are normal.  Contrast is seen within the colon, which is likely from prior
 contrast administration through the gastrostomy tube.  There is no
 extraluminal contrast identified.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Urinary bladder, rectum and uterus are
 unremarkable.  There is a small amount of pelvic free fluid, likely
 physiologic.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Gastrostomy tube, with an appearance of the pylorus invaginating more
 proximally into the stomach, causing a gastric outlet obstruction.  Recommend
 deflating the balloon, and/or repositioning, to see if this relieves patient's
 symptoms.  Associated moderate degree of free intraperitoneal air, which may
 be related to the recent gastrostomy placement.

 2.  Patchy areas of airspace opacities in the lungs bilaterally, likely
 infectious or inflammatory.

 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.

 4.  Fluid-filled esophagus at the level of thoracic inlet, which may be
 related to possible gastric outlet obstruction.

 INDICATION:  Evaluate tracheobronchomalacia.

 COMPARISON:  [**2198-2-9**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images of the lungs obtained without contrast,
 during inspiration and dynamic breathing.  Multiplanar reformatted images and
 3D reconstructed images were also displayed.

 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of previously seen tracheal
 stent.  The trachea appears flattened and irregular on inspiratory images,
 with cross- sectional dimensions of 6 x 27 mm at the level below the vocal
 cords, corresponding to an area of approximately 98 mm2.  On dynamic breathing
 images at a similar level, there is near- complete collapse of the trachea.
 The right main stem bronchus measures approximately 9 mm on the inspiratory
 images, and 7 mm on dynamic breathing images.  Left main stem bronchus
 measures approximately 7 mm inspiratory images and 4 mm on dynamic breathing
 images. Malacia changes seen on dynamic breathing images extend to the
 segmental and subsegmental levels.

 No focal consolidations identified in the lungs. There has been improvement of
 diffuse peribronchial tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 462**] opacities within the lower lobes
 bilaterally.  Small amount of residual peribronchiolar tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 462**] opacities
 seen particularly in the left lower lobe.  Findings again suggestive of
 chronic aspiration.  There are no pleural effusions.

 Dense coronary artery calcifications again seen.  No pathologically enlarged
 mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes identified.  Limited views of the upper
 abdomen grossly unremarkable.

 No suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesions are identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of tracheal stent.  Findings again consistent with
 tracheobronchomalacia with near complete flattening of the trachea on dynamic
 breathing images.
 2.  Findings consistent with chronic aspiration, improved compared to prior
 study.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hot neck lymph node on PET scan.  Please [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] overlying
 skin at dominant cervical lymph node writing up on PET scan.

 FINDINGS:  The patient was positioned supine with her head turned towards the
 right.  In this position, [**Name (NI) 30592**] indicated two dominant lymph nodes of
 similar size, corresponding to the location seen on the prior FDG imaging
 examination as well as prior ultrasound examinations.  The inferior of these
 lymph nodes demonstrated regions of hypoechogenicity, hazy shadowing
 posteriorly, suggesting that this may have been the calcified lymph node seen
 on the FDG imaging examination.  The more superior of these two nodes,
 measuring 1.9 x 0.9 x 1.0 cm in size, is the lymph node whose overlying skin
 was marked, indicated by an X, and initialed and dated.  This likely also
 corresponds to the lymph node which was aspirated on the [**2203-1-6**]

 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 2692**] [**Doctor First Name 141**] [**2117-4-22**] 5:25 AM
  PFI:  Slight interval increase in size of left basal ganglia and left caudate
  head nucleus hemorrhages.  Increased effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 503**] of the
  left lateral ventricle, however, otherwise no new mass effect.  No new
  hemorrhage.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left MCA infarct, status post TPA with post-procedure hemorrhage.
 Evaluate for further hemorrhage.

 COMPARISON:  Five hours prior.

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  Left basal ganglia hemorrhage has increased in size,
 now measuring 3.7 x 1.8 cm, previously 3.0 x1.3 cm.  The caudate nucleus head
 hemorrhage is more diffuse, but there is increased mass effect on the adjacent
 frontal [**Doctor Last Name 503**] of the left lateral ventricle.  Minimal 2 mm of rightward midline
 shift is stable.  Additional areas of petechial hemorrhage seen previously are
 not readily apparent.  There is no new hemorrhage.  No hydrocephalus or
 definite intraventricular extension.  The basal cisterns are preserved.
 Previously seen hyperdensity within the left MCA is not apparent.

 Areas of low attenuation within the right frontotemporal and parietal lobes
 reflect encephalomalacic changes from prior infarct and are unchanged.  The
 frontal sinuses are not pneumatized.  The remaining paranasal sinuses and
 mastoid air cells are clear.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Slightly increased hemorrhage within the left basal ganglia and caudate
 head with increased mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 503**] of the left lateral
 ventricle.  No hydrocephalus.  No new mass effect.

 2.  Unchanged encephalomalacia from old infarcts in the right frontal,
 temporal and parietal lobes.

 NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW:The increase in swelling of the left caudate
 and putamen likely reflect edema associated with infarction. As noted above,
 it is not clear that there has been any further bleeding. In addition, the
 high density may be in part due to contrast extravasation after arteriography.
 If it is important to distinguish hemorrhage from enhancement, then an MR
 examination, or continued follow up CT, may be helpful.

 HISTORY:  55-year-old female with history of pleural and pericardial effusions
 and a left pleural drain in place, now presenting with increasing dyspnea, to
 assess for disease status.

 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was performed.
 Comparison is made with prior radiograph of [**2188-4-19**].

 FINDINGS:

 There has been interval decrease in the bibasal effusions. Mild/early
 background CHF. The pleural drain is stable in position.  There is increased
 density in the right lower lobe, which may represent edema due to lung
 expansion versus infection. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There
 is a probable small residual left apical pneumothorax.

 CONCLUSION:

 1.  Mild/early CHF. Interval decrease in the bibasal effusions with added
 density in the right mid to lower zone, this may be edema due to lung
 expansion or due to superimposed infection. Please ensure followup to
 clearance.

 2.  Small residual left apical pneumothorax.

 bleeding, hypoxia and dyspnea.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study obtained [**2185-8-25**].

 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The pacemaker lead is in the right atrium
 with no right ventricle pacemaker lead demonstrated, unchanged since the prior
 study.  The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC.  There
 is interval progression of the right upper lobe opacities that might be
 consistent with recent aspiration giving the rapidity of the changes.  The
 bibasilar linear opacities consistent with atelectasis most likely are
 unchanged.  There is minimal bilateral pleural effusion with no significant
 change since the prior study.

 HISTORY:  31-year-old man with dizziness, with a dialysis catheter pulled out,
 evaluate for pneumonia.

 COMPARISON:  [**2135-11-12**].

 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  A catheter, likely a nasogastric tube, lies within the
 mid esophagus.  The heart is top normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vascular prominence likely
 reflects mild vascular congestion.  A moderate-sized left pleural effusion is
 larger, and a small right pleural effusion is smaller compared to prior study.
 Associated left basilar opacities are due to atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral pleural effusions, with the left larger in size.
 2.  Left lower lobe atelectasis.
 2.  Catheter overlies the mid esophagus, reflecting a retracted NG tube.

 HISTORY:  Followup subdural hematoma.

 Comparison is made to two most recent brain CTs, [**1-4**] and [**2176-2-15**].

 Previously noted right frontal subdural collection is now essentially
 isointense to the surrounding CSF with no significant mass effect on the
 adjacent gyri present.  There is no new regions of intracranial hemorrhage,
 mass effect, shift of midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute loss of
 [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white differentiation.  An old left corona radiata infarct and bilateral
 periventricular white matter hypoattenuating changes are stable.
 Atherosclerotic changes involving the cavernous carotids are stable with no
 paranasal sinus or calvarial abnormalities identified.

 IMPRESSION:  Stable right chronic subdural hematoma, which is essentially
 isointense to the surrounding CSF.  No new acute intracranial hemorrhage
 identified.

 HISTORY:  78-year-old woman, status post fall and bruising around the sacrum.
 Evaluate for body injury or signs of large hematoma.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast MDCT images were acquired from the lung bases to the
 pubis symphysis.  No IV contrast was given per special request from the trauma
 team.

 CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases are clear without
 pleural effusions.  The non-p.o. and non-IV contrast study significantly
 limits evaluation of intra-abdominal organs.  Allowing for the limitations,
 the liver is grossly normal without focal lesions.  The patient is status post
 cholecystectomy, with surgical clips at the empty gallbladder fossa.  The
 spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands are grossly normal.  The kidneys are
 normal in size.  A punctate nonobstructing calculus is noted in the left
 kidney (301B:25).  The renal pelves are prominent bilaterally, likely
 represent peripelvic cysts within the limits of non-IV contrast study.  A 4-mm
 exophytic hypodense lesion at the left mid pole is too small to be fully
 evaluated.  The ureters are normal in caliber.  The patient is status post
 distal gastrectomy with gastrojejunostomy.  There is no evidence of bowel
 obstruction.  Scattered small mesenteric lymph nodes are not pathologically
 enlarged.  There is no free air or fluid in the abdomen.  Aortic
 calcifications are mild-to-moderate.

 CT PELVIS:  An indwelling Foley catheter is noted in the mostly collapsed
 urinary bladder.  The colon demonstrates diverticulosis but without acute
 diverticulitis.  Trace fluid fluid is noted, but no free air or gross
 lymphadenopathy.  A moderate-sized intramuscular hematoma is noted in the left
 gluteal muscles with surrounding fat stranding.  The full extents of the
 hematoma is incompletely imaged, but where seen, measures 3.7 x 3.2 cm (2:77)
 in maximum cross-sectional dimension.

 BONE WINDOW:  There is no acute fracture or dislocation.  The visualized
 thoracolumbar spines are normal in alignment.  The sacrum is unremarkable.  A
 6-mm well-circumscribed lucency in the left iliac bone is nonaggressive in

 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW

 Lordotic positioning and underpenetration.  Allowing for this, a left
 subclavian line is present -- the tip overlies the SVC/RA junction. A right
 subclavian central line is present, tip over proximal SVC. An enteric tube is
 present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.

 The patient is status post sternotomy.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 prominent, but likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.  Multiple
 sternal wires are known to be fractured.  There is mild diffuse blurring,
 likely related to respiratory motion.  The possibility of CHF in this setting
 is difficult to exclude. There is patchy opacity at both lung bases. This is
 likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes, but again, in the setting, it
 difficult to exclude a pneumonic infiltrate.  There is slight obscuration of
 the right costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion is identified.

 Compared to [**2163-5-5**], the overall appearance is similar. The CHF findings
 may be slightly improved.

 restricted diffusion, or mass effect.  Ventricles and sulci are normal in size
 and configuration.  There are no areas on susceptibility to suggest
 hemorrhage.

 MRA:  Apparent loss of signal in the area of the supraclinoid right internal
 carotid artery and proximal MCA is likely artifact from known coils for the
 previously seen aneurysm.  No residual lumen is identified.  No new aneurysms
 are seen.  Major intracranial arteries remain patent.

 Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sternal pain following sternal plating.  Evaluate for healing, for
 possible removal of sternal plate.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images through the chest were obtained.  IV
 contrast was not administered.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were performed.
 1.25-mm and 5-mm slices were obtained.

 COMPARISON:  [**2156-2-13**].

 FINDINGS:  There has been interval development of a moderate right pleural
 effusion.  Calcifications of the coronary arteries are noted.  The heart size
 is normal.  Minimal calcifications of the arch of aorta are identified.  There
 is no pericardial effusion identified.  There is no axillary or hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  Prominent lymph nodes in the mediastinum are noted measuring
 up to 9 mm.  For example, there is a precarinal lymph node (2A, 18) measuring
 9 mm and a pretracheal lymph node measuring 6 mm (2A, 12).

 There is biapical pleural scarring.  1-mm subpleural nodule in the right lung
 (4A, 23) is noted.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Minimal
 atelectasis/scarring in the lingula and lung bases is noted.  The airways are
 patent to the subsegmental level.

 Patient is status post sternal plating using the Synthes system with one H
 plate at the manubrium and three horizontal plates, two 8-hole plates and one
 12-hole plate, transfixed with screws.  While there is no evidence of
 peri-hardware lucency, areas of the sternum and ribs appear inhomogeneous in
 the area of which the screws have been placed (for example, 4A, 70).

 There has been interval improvement in sternal dehiscence, which now measures
 approximately 2-3 mm in the proximal portion of the sternum and decreases to
 about 1-2 mm in the mid to distal portions of the sternum(previously measuring
 up to 11 mm in the proximal sternum on prior CT scan dated [**2156-2-13**]).
 However, there is no point where secure fusion of both sternal borders is
 identified beneath the sternal hardware. The nonunionized sternal components
 appear to have well corticated borders.

 There is no direct or indirect evidence of osteomyelitis or fluid collection
 to suggest abscess near the sternal closure device.

 Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a small hiatal hernia.  There
 is marked splenomegaly measuring approximately 18 cm.  Patient is status post
                                                             (Over)

 2.  No direct or indirect evidence of osteomyelitis or abnormal fluid
 collection.
 3.  Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes.
 4.  Marked splenomegaly, for which further evaluation is recommended if not
 already performed.
 5.  New small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
 6.  Small hiatal hernia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Severe trauma with right optic strut fracture, left petrous
 carotid canal fracture, and left occipital bone fracture near the transverse
 sinus.

 COMPARISON:  CTs of the head and facial bones performed concurrently.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT images of the head were obtained during
 intravenous contrast administration, according to CTA protocol.  Multiplanar
 two-dimensional reformatted images and volume-rendered three-dimensional
 reformatted images were generated.

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of right internal carotid artery dissection or
 narrowing at the level of the right optic strut fracture.  There is no
 evidence of left internal carotid artery dissection or narrowing at the level
 of the left petrous carotid canal fracture.  The major branches of the
 anterior circulation, as well as the major arteries of the posterior
 circulation, appear patent without evidence of stenoses or aneurysms.

 There is a filling defect in the left transverse sinus adjacent to the left
 occipital bone fracture, (images 2:79, 300B:32).

 Multiple intracranial, calvarial, skull base, and facial injuries are
 described in detail in the concurrent head CT and facial bone CT reports.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of right internal carotid or left internal carotid arterial
 injury at the level of the adjacent fractures.

 2.  Filling defect in the left transverse sinus adjacent to the left occipital
 bone fracture, which could indicate partial thrombosis or partial compression
 by a venous epidural hematoma.

 CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST

 INDICATION:  52-year-old woman with nephrolithiasis and urosepsis.  Please
 evaluate for kidney stone obstruction/hydronephrosis.

 COMPARISON:  CT torso without contrast [**2162-6-30**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images were acquired on a multidetector CT in the absence of
 intravenous contrast from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis.

 FINDINGS:
 There has been an increase in the small bilateral pleural effusions but more
 marked progression of the bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.  Superimposed
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  No suspicious pulmonary nodule is seen.
 The visualized heart, great vessels and pericardium are unremarkable in
 appearance on this non-contrast study.

 Non-contrast examination of the liver, adrenal glands and pancreas is
 unremarkable.  The gallbladder is surgically absent.  The spleen is enlarged
 measuring approximately 15 cm.  This is unchanged compared with previous
 imaging as far back as [**2152-10-27**].  The right kidney is normal in size
 measuring approximately 6.4 x 7.2 x 10 cm.  There is a tiny  0.2cm calcific
 density seen in the lower pole of the right kidney.  This is not causing any
 apparent obstruction and is unchanged in position compared with the previous
 study.  No hydronephrosis.  No perinephric fat stranding evident.  There is a
 small hypoattenuating lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney which is
 incompletely characterized on CT but could represent a small AML.

 The left kidney is swollen, measuring 9 x 6.5 x 11.2 cm with mild perinephric
 fat stranding.  The renal collecting system and ureter are not dilated on this
 side, so this appearance could be related to urosepsis rather than ureteric
 obstruction.  The previously identified calculus in the proximal left ureter
 is now seen to lie within the pelvis at the approximate location of the left
 vesicoureteric junction.  This calculus measures approximately 0.3 cm and is
 not causing any proximal hydronephrosis, although it has not yet passed into
 the bladder.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is collapsed around
 the Foley catheter.  The uterus, adnexal regions, sigmoid colon and rectum are
 unremarkable.  No free fluid is seen.  No pelvic lymphadenopathy.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**9-2**], there is some vague
 opacifications at the bases, especially in the right cardiophrenic angle.
 This may merely reflect atelectasis relating to lower lung volumes.  However,
 the possibility of a right basilar pneumonia cannot be excluded given the
 clinical history.  If the condition of the patient would permit, lateral view
 would be most helpful.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  45-year-old female with cirrhosis and large abdominal
 hematoma.  Please evaluate for pseudoaneurysm or extravasation.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contrast-enhanced CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis was
 performed following intravenous administration of 90 mL of contrast,
 administered without incident.  Non-contrast images were also acquired.
 Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were acquired.

 COMPARISON STUDIES:  CT abdomen from [**2147-8-5**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN:

 The visualized lung bases demonstrate a small left pleural effusion along with
 left basilar airspace disease, unchanged from the previous study.  The
 previous right pleural effusion has resolved and right basilar airspace
 disease has also improved.

 Punctate calcifications are visualized along the surface of the liver.  The
 liver is shrunken and nodular in contour with heterogeneous perfusion.  There
 are no discrete hepatic masses identified.  There is recanalization of the
 periumbilical vein.  The portal and splenic veins are patent.  The spleen is
 signficantly enlarged.  Postoperative changes from prior gastric bypass and
 cholecystectomy are noted.  There is no abnormal mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
 There is a moderate amount of abdominal ascites, essentially unchanged.  There
 is no extraluminal gas seen.  Loops of bowel in the abdomen are normal in

 axis and SMA are widely patent.  The kidneys and adrenal glands are normal.
 The pancreas is diffusely atrophic.  The extrahepatic biliary tree is markedly
 dilated, but unchanged.  There is no obstructing mass identified.

 CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE PELVIS:

 Evaluation of arterial branches is limited due to suboptimal CTA timing.
 There is no evidence to suggest active contrast extravasation or a
 pseudoaneurysm.  Again noted in the left lower quadrant is a large ventral
 wall subcutaneous hypodense collection with an enhancing rim and some internal
 hyperdense component on pre-contrast imaging. This measures 19.1 cm TV x 8.7
 cm AP x 15.0 cm CC.  This is essentially unchanged in size and appearance
 compared with the previous exam.  No new areas of hematoma are identified.
 There is a stable amount of ascites within the pelvis.  The uterus and adnexal
 structures are unremarkable.  Loops of bowel in the pelvis are normal in
 course and caliber.  Multiple paraumbilical varices are unchanged in
 appearance.  Diffuse third spacing of fluid is noted in the subcutaneous
 tissues.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:

 Review of the osseous structures demonstrates no evidence of lytic or blastic
 lesions.  There are no acute fractures identified.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Suboptimal CTA timing but widely patent vessels are demonstrated.  No
 evidence of active contrast extravasation or pseudoaneurysm.
 2.  Stable size and appearance of abdominal wall hematoma in the left lower
 quadrant.
 3.  Stable stigmata of cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
 4.  Unchanged amount of abdominal and pelvic ascites.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2984**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 382**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2419**] performed the procedure.
 Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2419**], the attending radiologist, supervised the entire procedure.

 PROCEDURE:  Informed consent was obtained outlining the risks and benefits of
 the procedure.  Following this, the patient was brought to the angiography
 suite and placed supine on the angiography table.  Preprocedure ultrasound was
 performed.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 11**] protocol.  Scout
 images were recorded.  Ultrasound was used to identify a suitable location for
 peritoneal drain placement.  The skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine and a
 19-gauge access needle was passed obliquely into the peritoneal cavity.  A
 0.035 J-tip wire was advanced into the peritoneal cavity under fluoroscopic
 guidance.  After making a small skin incision, the access site was dilated
 with 8 and 12 French dilators and a 16 French peel-away sheath was then
 advanced over the wire.  Attention was then turned to creation of the
 subcutaneous tunnel.  A suitable site, 7 cm posterosuperior to the peritoneal
 access point, was identified.  1% lidocaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine
 was used to anesthetize the tract. The 14 French Pleurx catheter was tunneled
 through the skin entry point to the peritoneal access site.  The catheter was
 then advanced through the peel-away sheath to lie across the midline in the
 pelvis.  The peritoneal access point was sutured with a 4-0 Vicryl
 subcuticular suture and Steri-Strips were applied.  The Pleurx catheter was
 secured to the skin with a 0 silk anchor suture.  A large sterile dressing was
 applied.  There were no immediate complications.  Following the procedure, 3
 liters of ascites was drained prior to transfer of the patient back to the
                                                             (Over)

 FINDINGS:  Ultrasound demonstrates large volume ascites with no obvious
 loculations.  A fluoroscopic scout image of the abdomen prior to procedure
 demonstrates a calcified uterine fibroid and a 6mm right-upper quadrant
 radiodensity of unclear etiology.  Ascites draining back during the procedure
 was clear and straw-colored. Post-procedure fluoroscopic film of the abdomen
 demonstrates satisfactory placement of the catheter traversing the midline in
 the pelvis with a smooth subcutaneous course.

 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory placement of a 14 French peritoneal drainage
 catheter via a right flank approach.  Successful drainage of 3 liters of clear
 ascites.  Patient information sheet and bag has been returned to the floor
 with the patient.

 TWO VIEW CHEST, [**2178-1-8**]

 COMPARISON:  [**2177-6-10**].

 FINDINGS:  ICD remains in standard position.  Heart size is normal.  Reduced
 volume of right hemithorax completed to previous wedge resection procedure
 with unchanged appearance of pleural and parenchymal scarring in the right
 lower hemithorax.  On the left, there is new posterior blunting of the left
 costophrenic sulcus, as well as an apparent contiguous pleural opacity along
 the posterior lower left pleural surface on the lateral view.  Review of CT
 scan of [**2177-11-14**], demonstrated no evidence of a pleural effusion on
 the left, but there was a focal parenchymal opacity posteriorly in the left
 lower lobe attributed to round atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged postoperative appearance of the right lung.
 2.  New small left pleural effusion with adjacent possible loculated component
 posteriorly in the lower left hemithorax.  Followup radiographs would be
 helpful to ensure resolution and to exclude an enlarging collection as entered
 into radiology communications dashboard on [**2178-1-8**].

 MESENTERIC ANGIOGRAPHY AND EMBOLIZATION

 PROCEDURES:
 1.  Right common femoral artery puncture.
 2.  Celiac and selective left gastric, gastroduodenal, and right epiploic
 angiograms.
 3.  Embolization of the mid right gastroepiploic with coils and Gelfoam.
 4.  Superior mesenteric and selective middle and right colic angiograms.
 5.  Inferior mesenteric angiogram.
 6.  Closure of right common femoral arteriotomy site with manual pressure.

 INDICATION:  68-year-old man with continued upper GI bleed with recent
 embolization of the left gastric artery.

 PHYSICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3268**] [**Name (STitle) 1368**] (fellow) and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 411**] [**Name (STitle) 412**] (attending
 interventional radiologist) who was present and supervising throughout.

 MEDICATIONS:  Moderate sedation was provided by administrating divided doses
 of 100 mcg of fentanyl and 1.5 mg of midazolam throughout the total
 intraservice time of 2 hours and 25 minutes during which the patient's
 hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.  The patient received 1
 unit of FFP and 1 unit of packed red blood cells and [**Pager number **] ml of normal saline.
 1% lidocaine was used for local pain control.

 CONTRAST:  160 ml of Optiray.

 TECHNIQUE:  After discussion of the details of the procedure and the risks,

 benefits and alternatives to the procedure with the patient and his wife,
 written informed consent was obtained from the patient's wife.  The patient
 was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.
 The right groin was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A
 preprocedure timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Using sterile technique and 1% lidocaine, the right common femoral artery was
 punctured with a 19 gauge needle under fluoroscopic and palpatory guidance.  A
 .035 [**Last Name (un) 89**] wire was advanced into the abdominal aorta under fluoroscopic
 guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5 French vascular sheath with the
 side arm attached to heparinized saline.  A 5 French [**Last Name (un) 4851**] catheter was
 used to select the celiac axis and subsequently the left gastric artery
 (previously embolized) which was further selectively catheterized using a
 Renegade HI-[**Last Name (un) **] catheter and 0.01 to 0.018 Transcend guidewire.  Next the
 gastroduodenal artery was selectively cannulated with the combination of the
 Renegade HI-[**Last Name (un) **] catheter and Transcend microwire.  An angiogram revealed
 extravasation in a branch from the mid right gastroepiploic in the left
 parasagittal plane overlying the greater curvature of distended stomach. Using
 a combination of the Renegade HI-[**Last Name (un) **] catheter and Transcend wire the mid right
 gastroepiploic was selected and two Cook .018 1 cm x 2 mm Hilal coils were
 deployed.  A Gelfoam slurry was next injected to near stasis.

 Next, attention was turned to the superior mesenteric artery.  The [**Last Name (un) 4851**]
 catheter was used to perform a SMA angiogram.  Using a combination of the
 Renegade HI-[**Last Name (un) **] catheter and Transcend guidewire, the right colic artery was
 selectively cannulated and a selective angiogram obtained.  Next attention was
 directed to the inferior mesenteric artery, which was also cannulated using
 the [**Last Name (un) 4851**] 5 French catheter before arteriography.

 Catheters and wires were removed.  The 5 French [**Last Name (un) 67**]-Tip vascular sheath was
 removed and manual pressure held for 20 minutes to obtain hemostasis.  The
 patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-
 procedure complications.

 FINDINGS:
 1.  No extravasation from the remaining branches of the embolized left
 gastric.
 2.  Extravasation from a branch of the mid right gastroepiploic. Two coils and
 Gelfoam were deployed.
 3.  No extravasation seen from the superior mesenteric or inferior mesenteric
 arteries or their branches.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful embolization of extravasation seen from a branch of
 the mid right gastroepiploic artery.

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after surgery with
 abdominal B-cell lymphoma.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2114-12-28**].

 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including slightly dilated
 mediastinum and bilateral hilar enlargement.  Perihilar opacities have
 slightly progressed in particular in the lung bases and might represent
 interval development of atelectasis but infectious process is another
 possibility.  Small amount of pleural effusion is bilateral and persistent.

 The evaluation of the PICC line demonstrates the tip of the catheter being
 seen at the junction of left subclavian vein and left brachiocephalic vein
 pointing slightly up toward the internal jugular vein.

 No definitive evidence of free intraperitoneal air is demonstrated on this
 semi-upright chest radiograph.

 IMPRESSION:
 Interval development of basal consolidation on the left, atelectasis,
 aspiration or infectious process is a possibility.  Bilateral areas of
 atelectasis, linear.

 Perihilar opacities and vascular engorgement might represent volume overload.

 Slightly abnormal position of the left PICC line as described in details
 above.

 INDICATION:  Fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were acquired from the lung bases through the
 proximal femurs without administration of intravenous contrast.  Multiplanar
 reformations were performed.

 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen/pelvis from [**2179-9-21**].

 ABDOMINAL CT:  Bibasilar atelectasis or vascular crowding due to low lung
 volumes is seen.  There is an unchanged calcified granuloma in the right lower
 lobe of the lung.  Relative hypodensity of blood in the cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1443**]
 indicates anemia.  Surgical clips from a prior CABG are noted.

 The liver is normal in appearance.  The patient is status post cholecystectomy
 and surgical clips are seen in the gallbladder fossa.  There is an unchanged
 13 x 16 mm hypodensity in the spleen.  The pancreas, adrenal glands, and
 kidneys are normal appearing.  The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable.
 There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen.  Diffuse
 vascular calcifications of the aorta, splenic artery, celiac axis, and iliac
 arteries are seen.  There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen.

 PELVIC CT:  There is a segment of bowel wall thickening involving the distal
 descending colon through the distal sigmoid colon.  Detailed evaluation is
 limited by poor underdistention and lack of IV contrast.  There is no
 pneumatosis or significant pericolonic fat stranding.  The transverse colon
 and proximal descending colon are distended with gas, though not frankly
 dilated.  There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen.

 BONE WINDOW:  Multiple degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine
 are seen.  Severe disc space narrowing is present at T8-9 and L4-5.
 Multilevel small anterior osteophytes are noted.  There is an old fracture of
 the eleventh right posterior rib.  A left hip gamma nail and intramedullary
 femoral rod are seen.

 HISTORY:  Bronchoscopy for possible tracheal tear.

 Subcutaneous emphysema in the deep tissues of the neck has improved and
 pneumomediastinum if any is minimal.  There is no pneumothorax or appreciable
 pleural effusion.  Nasogastric tube which previously terminated in the upper
 stomach now ends above the level of the carina and would need to be advanced
 at least 25 cm to move along the side ports into the stomach.  ET tube is in
 standard placement.  Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery.
 Midline drains and probable left thoracostomy tube are unchanged in their
 respective positions.  Hyperlucency and vascular deficiency in the right lung
 would raise concern for anterior pneumothorax, but subsequent chest radiograph
 available at the time of this review, performed 7:41 on [**12-16**] shows no
 right pneumothorax.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  83-year-old female with pleural effusion and rapid AFib
 with rapid RVR.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images were acquired of the chest before and after the
 administration of contrast.  Images were reformatted in the coronal, sagittal,
 and right and left oblique planes.

 FINDINGS:  There is dense contrast opacification of the right heart, with
 reflux into the IVC and hepatic veins.  The right and left atria are enlarged.
 Atherosclerotic calcification is seen of the aorta.  The pulmonary arteries
 are patent to the subsegmental level.  The central airways are patent.  No
 mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy is seen.

 There is pulmonary septal thickening most prominent in the bilateral apices,
 and there are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left
 with adjacent compressive atelectasis.  Evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma
 is somewhat limited by respiratory motion.  Linear atelectasis is seen within
 the lingula.

 The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There is somewhat exaggerated thoracic kyphosis, with
 multilevel degenerative disc disease.  No fracture is seen.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pulmonary embolism.

 2.  Dense contrast opacification of the right heart with enlarged atria
 bilaterally, and contrast reflux into the IVC and hepatic veins raises concern
 for right heart failure.  Findings along with pulmonary septal thickening is
 consistent with CHF.

 3. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  A 33-year-old man with fever of unclear etiology, status post
 allotransplant, evaluate for source of infection.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to the
 symphysis pubis following oral and intravenous contrast.  Sagittal and coronal
 reformats were produced and reviewed.

 COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2147-10-26**], and CT chest [**2147-12-6**].

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:
 No axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen.  No pleural or pericardial
 effusion seen.  The heart and great vessels are unchanged in appearance
 compared with the previous study.  The previously demonstrated ground-glass
 opacity at the left base is no longer apparent.  No concerning pulmonary
 nodules seen.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The spleen remains mildly enlarged measuring
 approximately 14 cm.  The liver, adrenal glands and both kidneys are
 unremarkable in appearance.  The pancreas is unremarkable in appearance.
 Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes which do not meet CT size criteria for
 pathologic enlargement (series 2, image 80).  These are unchanged compared
 with the previous study.  No mesenteric lymphadenopathy is seen.  No free
 fluid.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:
 The rectum, prostate, and bladder are unremarkable in appearance.  No free
 fluid seen.  No pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 with
 bilateral pars defects.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild persistent splenomegaly.

 CTA OF THE AORTA AND LOWER EXTREMITIES, [**2208-10-18**] AT 0720 HOURS

 HISTORY:  Cold right foot.

 TECHNIQUE:  Transverse images were acquired sequentially from the lung bases
 through bilateral feet before and after the uneventful administration of 100
 mL of Optiray 350.  Images were acquired post-contrast in the arterial phase
 with maximal aortic enhancement.  Immediate retrograde imaging from the feet
 through the popliteal fossa were then acquired to help document distal flow.
 Standard coronal and sagittal multiplanar reformatted images were generated.
 In addition, curved planar, MIP, 3D MIP, and volume-rendered images were also
 generated by the advanced 3D imaging laboratory.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the torso, [**2199-7-31**].

 FINDINGS:

 CTA:  Please note the evaluation particularly of the vasculature is markedly
 limited due to severe streak artifact from indwelling [**Location (un) 9153**] rods through
 the length of nearly the entire spine as well as due to indwelling hardware of
 the mid and distal femur and bilateral ankles.

 The distal thoracic and abdominal aorta is normal in contour, caliber and
 course.  No significant underlying atherosclerotic disease is noted.  There
 are normal mesenteric origins as well as normal bilateral renal arteries.  The
 left common iliac is relatively short with an early bifurcation into internal
 and external iliac branches.  Bilateral profunda femoris arteries are intact.
 There are no critical stenoses identified throughout the femoral and popliteal
 vasculature.

 There is a normal trifurcation on the right with contrast opacifying the
 vessels to the level of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery at the
 level of the calcaneus.

 On the right, there is opacification of both the anterior tibial and peroneal
 vessels with poor opacification of the proximal and mid aspects of the
                                                             (Over)

 posterior tibial artery.  There is, however, reconstitution of the distal left
 posterior tibial artery from peroneal artery collateralization.

 Again the evaluation at the ankle is limited due to streak artifact from
 indwelling hardware, no obvious lesion is noted.  There is mild
 circumferential edema in both ankles, relatively symmetric.

 CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS:  The study was not tailored for optimal organ or bowel
 evaluation.  Grossly, however, the solid abdominal organs are unremarkable.  A
 small hypoattenuated lesion is identified in the upper pole of the right
 kidney, stable from the prior exam.  There is no hydronephrosis.  The
 gallbladder is present, but otherwise unremarkable.  There is no bowel
 dilatation or wall thickening.  Moderate fecal loading is identified in the
 colon with a redundant sigmoid colon appreciated.  No diverticular disease is
 evident.  There is no free intraperitoneal fluid or air.  A 2.3 cm round
 hypoattenuated lesion is noted in the right adnexa, likely a functional versus
 paraovarian cyst.  Small rim-enhancing cystic lesions are identified in both
 adnexa, which possibly represent hemorrhagic cyst or corpus luteal cyst.
 Uterus images normally.  The bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter
 balloon.  No free intraperitoneal fluid or air noted.  There is no pathologic
 lymphadenopathy.  The indwelling G-tube is incidentally noted.

 Extensive consolidation is noted in the included lung bases.  It should be
 noted that relatively similar appearance of lung bases is seen on the remote,
 but most recent prior study in [**2198**].  However, additional consolidation for
 possible aspiration or basal pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded on the
 basis of this examination.  Correlate clinically.

 CT OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES:  As noted above, there is extensive streak
 artifact from a long lateral buttress plate extending from the mid proximal
 right femur to the femoral condyles fixated by multiple traversing cortical
 screws.  This reduces a mid diaphyseal femur fracture.  Additionally, there
 are indwelling hardware with large bone staples and bilateral ankles also
 resulting in significant streak artifact.  Anteromedial to the medial femoral
 condyle, best appreciated on series 3A, image #285, there is an 11 mm x 14 mm
 fluid collection with a thin rim of surrounding enhancement noted.  Marked
 atrophy of the bilateral gastrocnemius muscles is incidentally noted.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Three-vessel runoff to the right lower extremity including opacification
 of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries.  While there is
 predominantly two-vessel runoff at the popliteal fossa on the left lower
 extremity, there is reconstitution of the distal posterior tibial artery from
 peroneal artery collaterals resulting in opacification of both the dorsalis
 pedis and posterior tibial arteries at the ankle.

 2.  Overall very small fluid collection with a suggestion of rim enhancement
 medially adjacent to the right medial femoral condyle.  Given the size, this
 is of doubtful clinical significance and is not felt to represent an etiology
 for the apparent cold foot noted clinically.

 3.  Extensive bibasilar consolidation incompletely evaluated on this study.
 Of note, the relative consolidation is similar to that seen in the most recent
 albeit remote CT scan in [**2198**].  An element of chronic atelectasis is
 suspected.  However, superimposed pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Correlate clinically.

 4.  The intra-abdominal and intrapelvic structures are grossly stable within
 limitations.

 A preliminary report via wet read was provided immediately upon
 interpretation.  Formal dictation of the report was withheld until 3D images
 were returned from the imaging lab.

 Results were verbally relayed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8987**] at 11:50 a.m. on [**2208-10-18**]

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**10-27**], there is little overall
 change.  Continued low lung volumes with monitoring and support devices in
 place.  Bilateral pleural effusions persist.  There is again persistent
 gaseous distention of the stomach despite placement of a nasogastric tube.
 Prominence of the azygos vein raises the possibility of some right-sided
 cardiac failure.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes are again seen.

 FINDINGS:  Again seen are bilateral pleural effusions. Compared to the prior
 radiograph, the right effusion is slightly worse and the left effusion is
 stable.  There is stable elevation of the left hemidiaphragm suggesting
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged.  The right PICC
 has been removed.

 IMPRESSION:  Slight worsening of small right pleural effusion.  Stable small

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.

 INDICATION:  77-year-old male patient intubated with pneumonia, pleural
 effusion, status post thoracocentesis, evaluate for pneumothorax and interval
 change.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 portable AP chest examination obtained approximately 12 hours earlier during
 the same date.  The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position.
 The same holds for previously described right internal jugular approach
 central venous line.  A right-sided small caliber pigtail ending chest tube is
 now seen.  It was entered in the lateral chest wall at the level of [**6-29**]
 intercostal space.  This has resulted in a marked reduction of the previously
 existing density which thus was caused by pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax
 has developed.  There remains only mild blunting of the right lateral pleural
 sinus and the right lung base is now practically clear.  On the left side,
 pleural effusion remains with significant blunting of the lateral pleural
 sinus.  Neither right or left-sided apical pneumothorax can be identified.
 Remarkable is that the previously identified significant mediastinal shift
 towards the right has now normalized.  This apparently coincides with the
 disappearance of a right lower lobe sizeable infiltrate which was shown on
 chest CT examination of [**2151-3-31**].

 IMPRESSION:  Successful drainage of right-sided pleural effusion without
 evidence of complicating pneumothorax.  Stable position of ETT.  No new
 parenchymal infiltrates.

 INDICATION:  63-year-old male patient with right upper lobe adenocarcinoma,
 status post right upper lobectomy on [**2191-3-27**].  Complicated with right middle
 lobe torsion, now status post right middle lobe open lobectomy.  Assess chest
 findings.

 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position.
 Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of
 [**2191-4-5**].  The patient is now intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea
 some 5 cm above the level of the carina.  The next previous chest examination
 described density occupying the right apical portion of the hemithorax,
 interpreted as representing a right middle lobe replaced in this direction
 following right upper lobectomy, has now disappeared and is consistent with
 the clinically described right middle lobe resection performed surgically.
 Identified are now with two right-sided chest tubes, one of which reaches the
 apical area.  The postoperative density is in this apical location is small.
 The remaining right lower lobe shows normal vasculature and is well aerated
 without evidence of new infiltrates.  The lateral pleural sinus remains free.
 There exists an additional drainage tube that covers this area.  The
 left-sided hemithorax is grossly unchanged and thus there is no evidence of
 new pulmonary abnormalities.  Comparison also demonstrates that the previously
 present moderate degree of right-sided mediastinal shift has now normalized.

 IMPRESSION:
 Improved chest findings, no new abnormalities.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.

 INDICATION:  56-year-old female patient with fever, cough, and shortness of
 breath, history of smoking, recent orthopedic surgery, evaluate for possible
 pneumonia.

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination of [**2167-1-6**].  The heart size is within normal limits.  No
 typical configurational abnormality is seen.  There is a crowded appearance of
 pulmonary vasculature on the lung bases partially related to poor
 inspirational effort, but also caused by the patient's physical habitus with
 extreme obesity.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified and the
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.
 Comparison demonstrates that the patient has undergone a new orthopedic
 intervention in the left shoulder now with a metallic shoulder prosthesis and
 a row of metallic suture clips in the left shoulder area.

 Image quality is suboptimal related to patient's constitution.  A chest CT
 examination of [**2167-3-18**] is therefore reviewed, but this study did not
 identify any acute infiltrates, pleural effusions, or other pulmonary vascular
 abnormality.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of new pulmonary infiltrates, CHF, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**1-16**] through 18:

 Pulmonary edema has not recurred, but there is persistent obscuration of the
 right heart border which could be due to middle lobe pneumonia.  Smaller
 region of consolidation in the paracardiac region of the left mid lung could
 represent another focus of infection.  Mild cardiomegaly has improved since

 pneumothorax.  ET tube is in standard placement.  Transvenous right atrial,
 right ventricular, and left ventricular pacer leads follow their expected
 courses.  A left PIC line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.

 AP CHEST, 3:57 P.M., [**3-23**]

 HISTORY:  Trauma ET tube placement.  Question aspiration.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 5:20 a.m.:

 Mild pulmonary edema has developed, as is a large region of consolidation in
 the right lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.  Tip of the endotracheal tube
 is nearly at the carina and should be withdrawn 2 cm.  Heart size top normal.
 Subsequent radiographs available at the time of this dictation showed that by
 4:36 p.m., there is some improvement in edema, but persistence of probable
 right lower lobe pneumonia.

 COMPARISON:  [**2127-3-16**].

 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Patient is status post median sternotomy
 and CABG.  There are low inspiratory lung volumes.  This causes crowding of
 the pulmonary vascular markings and limits assessment of the lung bases.  The
 previous pattern of pulmonary vascular congestion has improved.  Patchy
 ill-defined airspace opacities in both lung bases may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be excluded.  No large pleural effusion is identified, and
 there is no pneumothorax.  A left-sided central venous catheter has been
 removed.  Clips are noted in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.

 IMPRESSION:  Low inspiratory lung volumes.  Interval improvement in previous
 pattern of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy ill-defined opacities in
 both lung bases, possibly atelectasis, but aspiration or infection cannot be
 excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 1.  AV fistulogram, AV thrombectomy, mechanical thrombectomy.
 2.  Placement of right femoral tunneled line.

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  50-year-old man with thrombosed right upper extremity AV
 graft, for assessment, thrombectomy and possible tunneled right femoral line
 placement.

 OPERATORS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13**] [**Name (STitle) 14**] (fellow) and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 197**] [**Name (STitle) 169**] (attending
 interventional radiologist), who was present and supervising throughout the
 entire procedure.

 PROCEDURES:
 1.  AV fistulogram.
 2.  Right upper extremity AV graft thrombectomy.
 3.  Balloon angioplasty of arterial anastomosis.
 4.  Intragraft balloon dilatation.
 5.  Venoplasty of subclavian vein stenosis.
 6.  Placement of a flare 7 mm endovascular stent graft at the venous
 anastomosis of the AV graft.
 7.  Placement of a 14 mm Luminexx graft at the central subclavian vein.
 8.  Placement of a right femoral venous catheter.

 ANESTHESIA:  General anesthesia was induced.

 TECHNIQUE:  After discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the
 procedure, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine
 on the imaging table.  The right upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual
 sterile fashion.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
 fashion.  A preprocedure timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital1 351**] protocol.

 Using palpatory and ultrasound guidance, the AV graft was accessed with a
 micropuncture 21-gauge needle both at its venous and arterial ends in an
                                                             (Over)

 antegrade and retrograde fashion respectively.  0.018 wire was advanced
 through each 21-gauge needle under fluoroscopic guidance.  4.5 French
 micropuncture sheaths were placed.

 A 0.035 angled Glidewire was advanced through the venous limb puncture site
 centrally.  A 5 French Kumpe catheter was placed over the wire. A pull back
 venogram demonstrated abscence of thrombus in the brachial axillary and
 subclavian veins. Very tight recurrent stenosis was demonstrated in the distal
 subclavian vein. The wire was then exchanged for a 0.025 J wire. Over 0.035
 Glidewire, the microcatheter sheaths were exchanged for 7 French Trerotola
 sheaths.  From the arterial limb puncture site, a Glidewire, then
 exchanged for a 0.025 J wire was advanced into the brachial artery. From the
 distal puncture site, a 7 French Trerotola infusion catheter with rotator was
 advanced through the venous anastomosis and passes made in order to perform
 thrombectomy. Next, the device was loaded on the arterial limb puncture site
 and and thrombectomy was performed throughout the entire graft.  Next, a 4
 French [**Doctor Last Name 4365**] embolectomy catheter was advanced across the arterial
 anastomosis, inflated and retracted. Flow was restored through the graft.

 A fistulogram was obtained. A stenosis at the arterial anastomosis was
 diagnosed and treated with a 4-mm Bard peripheral balloon over a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 180**]
 wire. Next, intragraft residual thrombosis was marginalized using a 7-mm
 balloon. Venography demonstrated tight recurrent stenosis at the venous
 anastomosis. Therefore, a 9 French x 11 [**Last Name (un) **]-Tip Cordis sheath was put in
 place at the distal 7 French Trerotola sheath.  Over a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 180**] wire, a 7
 mm x 50 mm FLAIR endovascular stent graft was placed over the venous
 anastomosis.  A 7-mm balloon was used to assist with deployment of FLAIR
 stent.  Subsequent venography demonstrated slow flow and stenosis at the
 proximal subclavian vein near the occluded stent in the left subclavian vein
 that crosses and abuts the wall of the SVC. After failure of angioplasty
 (12mm), a Bard Peripheral 14 mm x 16 mm x 80 cm Luminexx stent was placed over
 this stenosis. A 12-mm balloon was deployed centrally at the proximal SVC and
 the subclavian vein on the right progressively re-plastied. Subsequent
 venography demonstrated that the graft had re-occluded.
 Trerotola device-assisted thrombectomy and [**Doctor Last Name 4365**] embolectomy were repeated
 without success in restoring good flow through the access.

 Therefore, decision was made to convert the temporary right femoral venous
 line to a tunneled catheter.  A 0.035 Amplatz wire was advanced into the pre-
 existing catheter. Appropriate measurements were made. A subcutaneous tunnel
 was made from the lateral right side to the venotomy site. The tract was
 dilated and a peel-away sheath placed.  A 15.5 French x 55 cm x 50 cm tip-to-
 cuff tunneled dialysis catheter was subsequently placed under fluoroscopic
 guidance.  The tip was demonstrated to be in the right atrium. The line was
 secured to the skin with 0 silk suture.  Sterile dressings were applied.

 (Cont)

 The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the PACU for
 recovery.

 FINDINGS:

 1.  Thrombus throughout the graft, which was treated with Trerotola
 thrombectomy.

 2.  Stenosis at the arterial anastomosis, which was treated with [**Doctor Last Name 4365**]
 embolectomy and baloon angioplasty to 4mm.

 3.  Recurrent stenosis at the venous anastomosis, which was treated with a
 FLAIR endovascular stent.

 4. Recurrent stenosis at the proximal subclavian vein at its distal part,
 treated with a 14-mm stent.

 5.  Rethrombosis during the procedure, which was retreated with Trerotola
 thrombectomy.

 6.  Protracted rethrombosis.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unsuccessful mechanical thrombectomy, angioplasty of arterial anastomosis,
 stenting of venous anastomosis of AV graft and stenting of central stenosis.
 2.  Uncomplicated placement of a tunneled right common femoral venous
 hemodialysis catheter with tip in the right atrium.  The catheter is ready for
 use.

 INDICATION:  45-year-old woman with pancreatic transplant with question of
 acute cellular rejection versus chronic pancreatitis.

 COMPARISON:  CT torso of [**2115-6-29**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Split bolus dual-energy CT was obtained through the abdomen after
 the administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast and oral
 contrast.  Low-dose non-contrast CT was obtained through the abdomen and
 pelvis.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were displayed.

 FINDINGS:  The pancreas transplant is again noted within the left lower
 quadrant.  It enhances homogeneously and does not demonstrate any
 peripancreatic fluid.  Arterial supply is seen off of the left common iliac
 artery and is patent throughout.  The venous drainage appears to be to a
 branch off the superior mesenteric vein and is also patent.

 The lung bases demonstrate minimal dependent atelectasis.  The heart size is
 normal.  The spleen, adrenal glands, gallbladder, liver, stomach, and
 intra-abdominal loops of bowel are within normal limits.  The native left
 kidney is atrophic.  The native pancreas demonstrates atrophy.  The transplant
 kidney in the right lower quadrant is normal in appearance with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.  Please note, however, that
 the full contrast-enhanced transplanted kidney is not visualized.

 There is extensive calcification of the abdominal arterial vasculature. The
 noncontrast appearance of the pelvis is within normal limits.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No concerning osseous lesions are identified.  There is stable
 wedge compression fracture of vertebral body T12.

 IMPRESSION:  Homogeneous enhancement of the pancreatic transplant with no
 peripancreatic fluid collection.  Patent arterial supply and venous drainage.

 INDICATION:  CAD, assess for infiltrate or effusion preop for CABG.

 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.

 COMPARISONS:  None available.

 FINDINGS:  Extensive diffuse reticular interstitial pattern is seen suggestive
 of pre-existing pulmonary disease without superimposed consolidation.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bilateral hilar rounded prominence is
 seen.  Heart is top normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 Dense aortic knob calcification is noted.

 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse reticular interstitial opacities with bilateral hilar
 prominence could reflect sarcoidosis.  Correlation with prior history and
 outside imaging is recommended and if clinically indicated, a CT of the chest
 could be obtained for further evaluation.

 INDICATION:  49-year-old female with fibrosing mesenteritis, new right chest
 pain and tachycardia.

 COMPARISON:  [**2187-11-2**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Helical MDCT images were acquired through the chest without and
 with intravenous contrast, per the chest CTA protocol.  5- and 2.5-mm axial,
 5-mm coronal and sagittal, and 3 mm bilateral oblique multiplanar reformats
 were generated.

 FINDINGS:  There is no main, branch, lobar, or segmental pulmonary embolus.
 The main pulmonary artery is enlarged at 3.5 cm, indicative of pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.  The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber throughout.
 Heart is normal in size, with leftward bowing of the interventricular septum,
 indicative of right heart strain.  Calcifications are noted in the left
 anterior descending coronary artery.

 The left brachiocephalic vein is chronically attenuated, with numerous left
 chest wall and mediastinal venous collaterals, the majority of which drain
 into the azygos vein.

 Sub-1-mm pulmonary nodules are present in the right upper lobe (2:19).  There
 is no focal consolidation.  No pleural effusions are present.  Central airways
 are patent to the subsegmental levels.

 A prominent axillary node measures 7 mm in short axis, but demonstrates a
 fatty hilum.  Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are not pathologically
 enlarged.

 Note is made of a small hiatal hernia.

 Evaluation is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but reveals fatty

 INDICATION:  66-year-old female with hepatic failure, elevated INR and right
 frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage seen on outside hospital CT

 No prior examinations for comparison.  If images are received, an addendum can
 be dictated.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous non-contrast axial images were obtained through the
 brain, and reconstructed at 5-mm intervals.

 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is suboptimal due to patient motion.  There is an 8 x 6
 mm hyperdense focus of acute hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, centered at
 the [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white junction.  There is minimal effacement of the overlying sulci.
 No significant mass effect is noted.  Bifrontal subdural spaces are obscured
 by beam hardening artifact and patient motion.

 The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with age-related
 involutional changes.  Periventricular and subcortical white matter
 hypodensities reflect small vessel ischemic disease.  Calcifications are
 present in the bilateral cavernous carotid arteries.

 Moderate mucosal thickening is present in the bilateral maxillary sinuses,
 with surrounding hyperostosis indicating chronic disease.  Air-fluid levels
 are also present, left greater than right, indicating an acute component.  The
 remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  Nasogastric tube
 courses in expected position.  The orbits and intraconal structures are
 preserved.  11 x 6 mm soft tissue subcutaneous lesion is noted lateral to the
 left orbit, possibly representing a dermoid cyst.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Suboptimal study due to patient motion.  Focus of acute hemorrhage in
 right frontal lobe.  It is difficult to exclude extra-axial hemorrhage, and
 six-hour followup CT is recommended, with patient sedation if necessary.
 2.  Acute-on-chronic maxillary sinus disease.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  66-year-old female with hepatic failure secondary to
 Tylenol overdose.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  There is a coarse appearance of the liver parenchyma.  The
 visualized portions of the pancreas are normal appearing without masses,
 though the pancreatic duct is dilated to 6 mm.  A cyst is seen within anterior
 portion of the right lobe measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.9 cm without associated
 flow.  Normal hepatopetal flow is seen within the main, right
 anterior/posterior, and left portal vein.  Normal arterial waveforms are seen
 in the main, right and left hepatic arteries.  The hepatic veins are patent
 with proper direction of flow.  The common bile duct measures 7 mm.  The
 kidneys are normal in appearance bilaterally without hydronephrosis, stones,
 or masses.  The spleen is normal in size measuring 10.1 cm in the craniocaudal
 dimension.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Coarse echogenic liver compatible with acute liver injury from overdose.
 There is a simple cyst within the anterior right lobe, though sensitivity for
 other liver lesions is limited and other forms of liver disease such as
 hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.

 2.  Dilated pancreatic duct measuring 6 mm without obstructive mass seen.
 Recommend attention on followup.

 INDICATION:  44-year-old male with motorcycle accident, evaluate intracranial
 hemorrhage.

 COMPARISON:  [**2181-5-26**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous non-contrast axial images were obtained through the
 brain.  5-mm soft tissue and 2.5 mm bone kernel images were reconstructed in
 the axial plane.  2-mm coronal and sagittal multiplanar reformats were also
 generated.

 FINDINGS:  Mild soft tissue edema is noted at the right vertex.  Intracranial
 pressure monitor enters through the vertex and terminates within a right
 frontal lobe sulcus.

 Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage persists, most concentrated in the bifrontal
 lobes.

 There has been interval decrease in size of the left subdural hemorrhage,
 which now measures up to 5 mm in depth, previously 9 mm.  This demonstrates
 mixed hyper and hypodense attenuation, consistent with evolving blood
 products.  The collection tracks superiorly along the falx cerebri and
 inferiorly along the left tentorium cerebelli.  The left lateral ventricle is
 mildly effaced.  Rightward shift has decreased to 2 mm at the level of the
 septum pellucidum, previously 4 mm; and 3 mm at the level of the third
 ventricle, previously 4 mm.

 Two intraparenchymal hemorrhages in the right frontal and temporal lobes are
 stable in size at 1.3 x 1.2 cm and 7 x 5 mm, respectively.  There is a rim of
 surrounding vasogenic edema, with effacement of adjacent sulci.

 A tiny hyperdense focus (2:15, and 601B:62) is visualized in the right
 occipital [**Doctor Last Name 218**], likely representing new intraventricular extension of
 hemorrhage.

 There is mild mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal sinuses.  Large
 retention cysts are present in the bilateral sphenoid sinuses.  Small
 air-fluid levels are also noted in the right maxillary and bilateral sphenoid

 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2112-8-4**] AT 1733 HOURS.

 HISTORY:  Seizure and lethargy.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2112-6-14**].

 FINDINGS:  No consolidation or edema is evident.  Lung volumes are slightly
 improved over the prior examination.  Mild aortic tortuosity is again noted.
 There is again seen a prominent soft tissue convexity along the right lateral
 margin of the upper trachea near the thoracic inlet which has been noted on
 prior examinations.  No significant progression of this lesion is noted;
 however, this remains suspicious.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits
 for size.  No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  The osseous structures are
 non-contributory.

 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration with no definite acute pulmonary process.
 There is a persistent narrowing of the trachea superiorly.  If this has not
 been investigated previously, consider non-urgent CT for further evaluation.

 tube.

 STUDY:  T-tube check.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the
 patient and the patient verbally consented to the procedure.  A single scout
 image was taken.  Approximately 50 cc of Optiray contrast [**Doctor Last Name 1309**] was injected
 into the T-tube.  Contrast entered the gallbladder and flowed from the
 gallbladder into the cystic duct and down the CBD into the duodenum.  In the
 last image, a small amount of contrast had refluxed up into the intrahepatic
 biliary system.  No extraluminal contrast was visualized.  The tube was then
 gently flushed with approximately 50 cc of saline and recapped.  The patient
 tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Cholecystostomy tube in place without evidence of leakage.

 Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 9505**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 612**] at 17:28 on [**2180-2-5**].

 INDICATION:  Status post thoracocentesis, to rule out pneumothorax.

 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP portable radiograph of chest.

 Comparisons were made with prior chest radiographs from [**2189-10-15**] and
 [**2188-5-24**].  Concurrently, a chest CT from [**2189-10-15**] was also
 reviewed.

 FINDINGS:

 Following right thoracocentesis, moderate right pleural effusion is smaller.
 There is no pneumothorax.  Multifocal, right lung consolidation including a
 large necrotizing consolidation in the right suprahilar region is unchanged.
 Assessment of lung consolidation is better on recent chest CT dated [**10-15**], [**2188**]. Left lower lung atelectasis is stable.  There are no opacities of
 concern for pneumonia in left lung.  Stable top normal heart size, mediastinal
 and hilar contours.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Following right thoracocentesis, moderate right pleural effusion has
 decreased.  There is no pneumothorax.
 2.  Since [**2189-10-15**], multifocal lung consolidations, including large

 COMPARISON:  Recent chest radiograph from [**2167-11-27**] and chest radiograph from
 [**2167-11-17**].

 TECHNIQUE:  64 MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic inlet to the upper
 abdomen were displayed with 1.25- and 5-mm slice thickness.  No intravenous
 contrast was administered.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were prepared.

 CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The thyroid gland is homogeneous
 without focal nodule.  No supraclavicular, infraclavicular, axillary,
 mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy is identified.  A right-sided central
 venous catheter terminates within the medial right subclavian vein.  The
 endotracheal tube terminates 2.7 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and is within the stomach.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged, however, there is no pericardial effusion.  The
 ascending aorta appears mildly dilated measuring 3.8 x 4.0 cm at the level of
 the main pulmonary artery (2:24).  Additionally, the main pulmonary artery is
 also prominent measuring 3.1 cm, at the upper limits of normal (2:24).
 Moderate atherosclerotic calcification is seen throughout the thoracic aorta
 as well.  No mediastinal hematoma is identified to suggest aneurysm leak.
 Evaluation for aortic dissection is limited on this noncontrast examination.
 Minimal coronary atherosclerotic calcifications are identified within the left
 anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries.
 Additionally, calcifications of the aortic valve are also identified (2:33).
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on the

 right.

 The endotracheal tube is in adequate position and the tracheobronchial tree is
 patent to subsegmental levels.  Minimal atelectasis is identified in the lung
 bases.  Mild apical scarring is noted as well as calcified pleura within the
 left lung apex.  There is extensive respiratory motion resulting in
 heterogeneous attenuation throughout the lungs.  However, no confluent
 consolidation is identified.

 Though not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the imaged upper
 abdominal viscera appear within normal limits.  Calcifications are identified
 within the abdominal vasculature.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Multiple bilateral rib fractures are identified, some
 appear healed, though others appear acute.  No bone destructive lesion is
 identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Standard position of support devices.
 2.  Mildly dilated ascending thoracic aorta, though no evidence of aneurysm
 leak (no mediastinal hematoma).  Limited evaluation for dissection given the
 lack of IV contrast.
 3.  Main pulmonary artery measuring at the upper limits of normal, possible
 mild pulmonary hypertension.
 3.  Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  54-year-old woman with angiogram and angioplasty for
 vasospasm after coiling for aneurysm.  To assess for vasculature.

 STUDY:  CTA head with contrast.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  CTA head dated [**2161-9-3**] and CT head dated [**9-1**], [**2160**].

 TECHNIQUE: Continous axial CT images were obtained of the brain prior to
 administration of contrast.  Subsequently, rapid axial imaging was performed
 through the brain during intravenous administration of contrast. Images were
 processed on a separate workstation with display of curved reformats, 3D
 volume rendered images and maximum intensity projection images.

 FINDINGS:

 NON CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is no change in the extensive intraparenchymal,
 bilateral subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhages.  There is no change
 in the extensive left hemispheric edema.  The shift of midline structures to
 the right by 15 mm is unchanged.  The ventricular size is grossly stable.  The
 ventriculostomy catheter tip ends in the third ventricle.  Streak artifact is
 noted from the coil pack in the left supraclinoid ICA region.  The assessment
 of the coiled aneurysm for patency is limited due to the artifact.
 Postoperative status is noted in the form of left frontal craniectomy.
 Air-fluid levels are noted in bilateral maxillary sinuses.  Mucosal thickening
 is noted in bilateral ethmoid air cells.  There is partial opacification of
 bilateral mastoid air cells.

 CTA HEAD:
 There is improved caliber of bilateral middle cerebral arteries as compared to
 the prior study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  67-year-old male with tuberculum sella mass.  Presurgical mapping
 evaluation.

 EXAMINATION:  MRI of the brain with intravenous contrast.

 COMPARISONS:  Reference examination from [**2152-8-1**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1-weighted images were obtained after the uneventful
 administration of 20 cc of gadolinium intravenous contrast.  Sequences include
 conventional T1 spin echo, and coronal, sagittal and axial MP-RAGE
 reformations.

 FINDINGS:

 This examination is done with fiducial markers in place for pre-surgical
 planning.
 Redemonstrated is a homogeneously enhancing mass measuring approximately 2.3 x
 2.0 cm in the CC x TRV dimensions with board-based dural attachment to the
 planum sphenoidale with overall characteristics compatible with a meningioma.
 This mass extends inferiorly immediately adjacent to the right aspect of the
 infundibulum with contact in this region.  Superiorly there is extension with
 mass effect on the inferior orbital frontal region and possible extension
 along the right olfactory groove.  There appears to be possible leftward
 displacement of the right ACA and the right supraclinoid ICA traverses
 immediately adjacent to the right lateral aspect of this mass.

 The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.  There are hardware
 artifacts from known left frontoparietal craniotomy.  The ventricles and sulci
 are stable in size and configuration.  There are no other areas of abnormal
 enhancement with no abnormal parenchymal, leptomeningeal or pachymeningeal
 enhancement.  The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
 cells are well aerated.

 IMPRESSION:  Presurgical planning evaluation for a homogeneously enhancing
 mass arising from the planum sphenoidale as detailed above.

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  Pulmonary embolism
 No contraindications for IV contrast
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with metastatic colon with chest pain and tachycardia of
 unknown etiology, suspected pulmonary embolism.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax was performed using standard
 department protocol.  Contiguous axial images at 5-mm and 2.5-mm slice
 thickness were reviewed concurrently with coronal and sagittal reformats.
 Comparisons were made with prior chest CT study from [**2128-8-31**] and CT torso
 study from [**2128-8-10**].

 FINDINGS:

 PULMONARY ARTERY:  The caliber of the main pulmonary artery proximal to
 bifurcation measures 22 mm and is normal.  There is no filling defect within
 the main lobar and segmental branches of pulmonary artery to suggest pulmonary
 embolism.  The aorta and great vessels are unremarkable.

 AIRWAYS AND LUNGS:  The bronchus intermedius is abruptly occluded
 approximately 2-2.5 cm beyond its origin and is similar in appearance to prior
 chest CT dated [**2128-8-10**].  A large mass-like consolidation in the right lower
 lobe with heterogeneous enhancing areas reflecting large necrotic metastatic
 lesion and less likely necrotizing pneumonia has overall increased in size
 since [**2128-8-10**]. This mass like consolidation is causing attenuation of the
 pulmonary vessels and airways to right lower lobe. The loculated effusion as
 well as free fluid in the right lung base has decreased (the component of
 lobulated effusion showing a significant decrease).  Thick rind-like
 enhancement along the posterolateral aspect in the lower right chest
 representing metastatic deposit has increased since prior study.  Again seen
 are multiple pleural based deposits on the right side.  Previously seen lung
 deposits are overall unchanged.  For example, 8-mm nodule in the superior
 segment of the left lower lobe (3:37) was previously 8 mm. However, a large
 right upper lobe nodule previously seen on [**2128-8-10**] CT (3a:1) is not
 visualized on present study probably because of the increased mass-like
 consolidation and increased size of adjacent loculated effusion obscuring the
 nodule.

 MEDIASTINUM:  The thyroid gland is normal.  Since [**2128-8-10**], the overall bulk
 of enlarged mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy is overall unchanged
 barring the differences in enhancement pattern.  For example, paratracheal
 lymph node measuring 22 x 15 mm (3:18) was previously 21 x 14 mm.  The heart

 is normal in size without pericardial effusion.

 ABDOMEN:  The study is not designed for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic
 pathology; however, limited views were remarkable for multiple heterogeneous
 hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver consistent with
 metastasis. Allowing for differences in CT techniques the largest lesion
 measuring 3.7 x 3.6 cm was previously 4.5 x 4.2 cm.  This apparent smaller
 appearance may be be due to difference in technique and enhancement pattern of
 liver parenchyma. Both suprarenal glands are unremarkable.

 BONES:  There is no bone lesion suspicious for malignancy/infection.


 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

 2.  Since [**2128-8-10**] large heterogenous mass-like consolidation likely from
 multiple necrotic metastatic deposits in the right lower lobe causing
 attenuation of the pulmonary vessels and airways and occlusion of the right
 intermediate bronchus has increased in size.

 3. Multiple pleural deposits on right side with loculated and moderate free
 effusion. Effusion has minimally decreased since [**2128-8-10**](Loculated effusion
 showing more changes).

 4. Multiple pulmonary metastases are stable since [**2128-8-10**].  However,
 dominant nodule in the right upper lung could not be seen on the present scan
 due to recently increased size of mass like consolidation and adjacent
 lobulated effusion obscuring the details.

 5. Multiple liver metastases which appear smaller than before may be secondary
 to differences in parenchymal enhancement.

 6. Metastatic deposit along posterolateral aspect of right lower chest has
 progressed.

 INDICATION:  36-year-old man status post trauma.

 SINGLE SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Evaluation is limited by underlying
 trauma board.  Patient is intubated with endotracheal tube ending
 approximately 2.4 cm above the carina. The ETT balloon may be mildly
 overdistended.  NG tube is seen coursing to the stomach, although the tip is
 excluded from view.  Lung volumes are low.  Patchy opacities at the lung bases
 are most consistent with aspiration, as seen on outside hospital torso CT.
 Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes. The mediastinum is widened;
 however, this can be attributed to mediastinal lipomatosus as seen on the OSH
 CT.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Visualized osseous
 structures are intact.

 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with bilateral lower lobe aspiration,
 better evaluated on outside hospital CT torso.

 INDICATION:  70-year-old male with new hemoptysis status post recent
 tracheostomy placement.  Question tracheoinnominate fistula.

 COMPARISON:  Reference CT neck from outside facility dated [**2194-5-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the neck was performed prior to and following
 administration of intravenous contrast as per CTA protocol.  Multiplanar
 reformations were generated.

 FINDINGS:  A subcentimeter hypodensity with associated coarse calcification is
 seen in the inferior aspect of the right lobe of thyroid, suggestive of a
 nodule, poorly evaluated on current exam but appears similar as compared to
 recent prior reference examination dated [**2194-5-15**].

 Patient is status post tracheostomy with the tip terminating in the mid
 trachea, projecting posteriorly lodged in the posterior tracheal wall (301b,
 58).  It is unclear whether this could be abutting a small submucosal vessel
 or causing mucosal irritation.  There is no clear communication between the
 tracheostomy tube and subjacent vascular structures including the innominate
 artery to suggest fistula formation.  Great vessels appear patent without
 evidence of acute injury.  Moderate diffuse atherosclerotic disease is
 present.  The aorta is normal in caliber throughout.  The main pulmonary
 artery measures 4.5 cm, consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 There are prominent mediastinal lymph nodes in the prevascular, pretracheal,
 and precarinal stations measuring up to 1.2 to 1.3 cm.  There is no axillary
 lymphadenopathy.

 Polypoid mucosal disease is present in the left maxillary sinus.  Extensive
 atheromatous changes and calcifications involve both carotid arteries, most
 significant at the bifurcation.  There is moderate right pleural effusion with
 associated atelectasis.  Background emphysema is present.  For further
 assessment of lungs please refer to accompanying dedicated chest CT.

 Visualized airways are patent.

 CTA OF THE HEAD WITH RECONSTRUCTIONS, [**2102-5-19**]

 TECHNIQUE:  Initial contiguous 5-mm axial MDCT sections were obtained from the
 skull base through the vertex, prior to contrast administration.  Helical 1.25
 mm axial MDCT sections were then obtained through the same imaging volume
 during the dynamic intravenous administration of 70 mL Optiray-320.  Coronal,
 sagittal and axial thick-slab MIP and rotational volume-rendered
 3D-reconstructed images through the cranial vessels were then obtained and
 viewed on a separate workstation.

 FINDINGS:  The study is compared with most recent NECT of [**2102-5-15**], the
 previous study of [**2101-8-12**] and a series of examinations dating to the cranial
 CTA (and reconstructions) of [**2101-7-21**].

 The patient is status post recent placement of a right transfrontal EVD with
 tip reaching the lateral aspect of the right lateral ventricular frontal [**Doctor Last Name 383**],
 as before.  There has been interval resolution of the post-procedural
 pneumocephalus.  Compared to the more remote studies, there is marked
 dilatation of the entire ventricular chain and, in comparison to the most
 recent studies, there has been decrease in the overall amount of
 intraventricular blood with some further dilatation of the third and left
 lateral ventricle, particularly its atrium and temporal [**Doctor Last Name 383**].  Since the most
 recent studies, there has been some improvement in the diffuse cerebral edema,
 particularly in the brainstem, as well as the left parafalcine and tentorial
 subdural hematoma, with improvement in degree of cerebellar tonsillar
 herniation.

 As before, the patient is status post coiling of left PCom aneurysm with

 metallic streak artifact from the coil packs limiting the assessment of the
 aneurysm, itself, as well as the immediately adjacent region.  However,
 allowing for this, in comparison to the CTAs of [**8-3**] and [**2101-7-21**], there has
 been no definite change in vascular caliber, contour or branching pattern to
 specifically suggest acute cerebral vasospasm.  There is a persistent
 hypoplastic appearance to the posterior circulation, including both vertebral
 arteries and the basilar and bilateral posterior cerebral arteries, but this,
 too, is unchanged.  No new vascular occlusion or stenosis is identified within
 the intracranial circulation.  Again demonstrated is moderate atherosclerotic
 mural calcification involving the cavernous carotid arteries.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post recent placement of right transfrontal ventriculostomy
 catheter, in stable position; however, there has been a minimal increase in
 the size of, particularly, the left lateral and third ventricle, despite the
 decrease in the overall amount of intraventricular blood.
 2.  Interval slight decrease in the amount of cerebral edema and the left
 parafalcine and tentorial subdural hematoma.
 3.  Status post coiling of left PCom aneurysms, limiting their evaluation;
 however, no new vascular stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm larger than 2 mm is
 identified.
 4.  Redemonstration of the relatively hypoplastic posterior circulation;
 allowing for this, there is no finding to specifically suggest acute
 vasospasm.

 COMMENT:  A preliminary interpretation to this effect was posted to CCC by Dr.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  78-year-old man with bleeding from the external auditory canal
 after head trauma, and known SAH and SDH; evaluate for temporal bone fracture.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the head without contrast, [**2113-6-9**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Helical axial 0.625mm MDCT images were acquired through the
 temporal bones without intravenous contrast.  Sagittal, coronal and oblique
 (Stenvers and [**Last Name (un) 41550**] imaging planes) reformations were generated and reviewed
 on a separate workstation.

 FINDINGS:  There is a longitudinal fracture of the right temporal bone
 extending from the petrous portion, likely to the squamous portion, better
 visualized in the axial images (2:12).  There is opacification of the major
 portion of the right mastoid air cells and the external auditory canals, the
 middle ear cavity.  The ossicles appear intact.  No fractures are identified
 in the left temporal bone.  Minimal soft tissue is seen within the left
 external auditory canal, likely impacted cerumen.  There is diffuse
 opacification of the ethmoidal air cells, bilaterally, with an air-fluid level
 in the left maxillary sinus.  Minimal mucosal thickening is seen within the
 right maxillary sinus and the sphenoid air cells.

 IMPRESSION:  Longitudinal fracture through the right petrous temporal bone.
 No evidence of ossicular disruption.  Opacification of the right mastoid air
 cells, external auditory canal and middle ear cavity.

 NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The right temporal bone fracture is comminuted
 and complex, with extensive involvement of its mastoid segment. A fracture
 component traverses the middle ear cavity, where it involves the ossicular
 chain. While the malleus and incus appear to maintain a normal relationship,
 there is evidence of incudo-stapedial dissociation, with likely fracture of
 the stapes superstructure, and the stapes footplate appears displaced from the
 oval window; these findings are best-appreciated on the specialized
 reformations. The fracture appears to spare the otic capsule. A fracture
 component does exit at the glenoid fossa, but there is no evidence of
 subluxation of the TMJ.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  63-year-old male with history of colectomy and Hartmann's pouch,
 now with abdominal pain and hypotension.

 COMPARISON:  [**2138-5-16**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images through the abdomen and pelvis were acquired after
 administration of intravenous and oral contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformatted images were reviewed.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV AND ORAL CONTRAST:  A large left pleural effusion is
 smaller compared to prior with persistent compressive atelectasis.  There has
 been interval decrease in size of the right pleural effusion which is now
 minimal.  Minimal right basilar atelectasis is seen.  Right middle lobe linear
 opacity is unchanged.  The visualized portion of the heart demonstrates
 coronary artery calcification.  A sliver of perihepatic ascites is unchanged.
 The liver and gallbladder are grossly unremarkable.  Peripheral hypodensity in
 the spleen as seen before may represent a prior infarct.  The pancreas,
 adrenal glands, right kidney, and visualized portions of the ureters are
 grossly unremarkable. Left renal hypodensities are again seen and likely
 represent cysts.  The patient is status post colectomy; ileostomy and
 Hartmann's pouch appear unchanged.  Stomach is grossly unremarkable; a G-tube
 is seen with tip in the stomach (tip formerly in the jejunum was retracted per
 Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3609**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16980**]).  Note is made of mildly dilated and fecalized loops of
 small bowel proximal to the ileostomy, which is likely secondary to fecal
 impaction, less likely stricture at the ileostomy.  There is no free air or

 ascites.  A midline surgical wound is again noted with an anterior abdominal
 wall collection inferiorly which appears slightly smaller compared to prior,
 likely a resolving hematoma.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV AND ORAL CONTRAST:  The bladder contains a focus of
 air, which is likely secondary to recent catheterization.  The prostate
 contains coarse calcifications and the seminal vesicles are grossly
 unremarkable.  There is no free fluid.  Hartmann's pouch and anastomosis
 appear unchanged.

 Bony structures demonstrate degenerative changes.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Fecalized, mildly dilated loops of distal small bowel leading up to the
 ileostomy, likely due to fecal impaction, and less likely due to a stricture
 at the ileostomy as there was no evidence of obstruction on the prior CT from
 approximately 2 weeks ago.

 2.  Air in the bladder, possibly due to recent instrumentation but clinical
 correlation is recommended as infection cannot be excluded.

 INDICATION:  43-year-old male with psychiatric decompensation and known kidney
 stones with continued right flank pain.

 COMPARISON:  [**2129-5-24**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen and
 pelvis without IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were displayed.

 CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Lung bases are clear.  The liver, pancreas,
 spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands have a normal non-contrast-enhanced CT
 appearance.  The gallbladder is not visualized.

 The kidneys are symmetric in size.  There are several (approx 5)
 calcifications in the right renal calices, measuring up to 5 mm and compatible
 with nonobstructing stones.  There is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  There
 is no perinephric stranding or perinephric fluid collection.

 There is suture along the proximal stomach which is compatible with a
 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. The gastric remnant is slightly distended
 with ingested material. The excluded stomach is decompressed. Small bowel is
 essentially collapsed.  There is no free air or fluid in the abdomen.  No
 mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy meeting criteria for pathologic
 enlargement is noted.

 CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder, distal ureters, seminal
 vesicles, prostate, sigmoid colon, and rectum are normal.  There is no free
 fluid in the pelvis.  No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is present.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is identified.
 Old right rib fracture is noted.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Nonobstructing right renal stones measuring up to 5 mm without
 hydronephrosis.
 2.  Post surgical change from prior gastric bypass.

 [**Hospital 2**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
  40 year old woman with new hiccups and stroke of right pons, left cerebral
  peduncle, left occipital lobe from distal basilar artery occlusion, likely
  embolic.
 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  r/o embolic stroke in pt w/ hiccups
 No contraindications for IV contrast
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Basilar tip occlusion with pons, left cerebral peduncle, and left
 occipital lobe infarction.  Patient has new hiccups.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the brain was performed both
 with and without contrast per departmental protocol.

 MRA HEAD:  3D time-of-flight MRA angiography was performed of the brain with
 rotational reconstructions.

 COMPARISON:  MRI of the brain performed [**2158-5-2**].  CTA of the head
 performed [**2158-5-1**].

 FINDINGS:
 MRI BRAIN: The region of restricted diffusion involving the right pons is now
 more extensive involving nearly the entire right pons with some sparing of the
 posterolateral aspect.  The region of restricted diffusion extends to the
 previous posterior right medial focus of restricted diffusion.  The restricted
 diffusion involving the left midbrain/cerebral peduncle has also increased in
 size and extent.  There is a new approximately 14 mm in greatest dimension
 region of restricted diffusion involving the superior left cerebellar
 hemisphere.  The small focus of restricted diffusion within the mid left
 cerebellar hemisphere has not significantly changed.  The punctate focus of
 restricted diffusion identified on the prior study within the white matter of
 the left occipital lobe is not definitely identified.  There is no evidence of
 intracranial hemorrhage.  The regions of restricted diffusion do not
 demonstrate gradient signal artifact to suggest hemorrhage.  No other new foci
 of restricted diffusion are identified.  There is FLAIR hyperintensity within
 the mid and distal basilar artery with loss of the T2 flow void in this
 location correlating with the previously documented thrombus within the
 basilar artery.

 The supratentorial parenchymal [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white matter differentiation is
 maintained.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration and
 unchanged.  There is no evidence of mass, mass effect, or shift of midline
 structures.

 MRA HEAD:  There is lack of flow signal within the distal basilar artery,
 similar to that seen on the prior study.  The proximal basilar artery and the
                                                             (Over)

 left vertebral artery are slightly less hyperintense in flow signal compared
 with the prior study possibly related to the distal occlusion.  Again noted,
 the right intracranial vertebral artery is hypoplastic, predominantly
 supplying the PICA on that side which is congenital variation.  The internal
 carotid arteries, middle and anterior cerebral arteries, posterior cerebral
 arteries and posterior communicating arteries are patent with normal flow
 signal and caliber.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New superior left cerebellar focal infarction compared with one day ago.
 The regions of infarction involving the right pons and left cerebral
 peduncle/mid brain have increased in size and extent as described above.  The
 punctate focus of possible slow diffusion within the mid left cerebellar
 hemisphere is unchanged.  The small punctate focus of possible restricted
 diffusion within the left occipital white matter is not appreciated on today's
 study.  None of these regions of infarction demonstrate hemorrhage or
 significant mass effect.
 2.  MRA of the head is unchanged and continues to show occlusion of the mid to
 distal basilar artery.  As mentioned on the prior study, the right
 intracranial vertebral artery is hypoplastic predominantly supplying the PICA
 which is a congenital variation.  The remainder of the MRA of the brain is
 normal.

 This case was discussed in the neurology/neuroradiology conference at 9:30
 a.m., [**2158-5-4**].

 DRAINAGE CATHETER PLACEMENT:

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  81-year-old man with cholangitis status post unsuccessful
 ERCP for drain placement for ERCP rendez-vous.

 COMPARISON:  CT from [**2145-5-3**].

 OPERATORS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1450**] [**Name (STitle) 194**] (fellow) and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
 (interventional radiologist) was present and supervising throughout the entire
 procedure.

 MEDICATIONS:  The procedure was initiated after the induction of general
 anesthesia.  1% lidocaine was used for local pain control.

 TECHNIQUE:  After discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the
 procedure, written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to
 the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.  The right upper
 abdomen was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure
 timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital 51**] medical protocol.

 Under fluoroscopic guidance, an AccuStick needle was sequentially introduced
 into the liver and withdrawn with concomitant injection of dilute contrast.
 After opacification of a nondilated right hepatic duct, a headhunter guidewire
 was advanced into the lower common bile duct.  The inner portion of the
 Accustick system was introduced into the CBD.  Contrast injection confirmed
 location.  A 0.035 superstiff glide was advanced into the common bile duct.  A
 6 French [**Last Name (un) 169**] Tip sheath was introduced.  Using a combination of a 5-French
 Kumpe catheter and glidewire, the papillae was traversed.  The Kumpe catheter
 and guidewire was advanced into the more distal duodenum.  The glide was
 exchanged for a 0.035 superstiff Amplatz.  The sheath was removed, and an 8.5
 French Cook catheter advanced under fluoroscopic guidance.  The locking
 pigtail loop was formed and the pigtail retracted into optimal position
 confirmed by contrast injection.  The catheter was attached using [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
 sandal-type suture with 0 silk.  A bag was attached.  Sterile dressings were
 applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the
 ICU.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  57-year-old male with pancreatitis and question of
 abdominal pseudoaneurysm, s/p ultrasound guided thrombin injection.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images were acquired of the abdomen and pelvis before and
 after the administration of contrast as well as a 90-second delayed phase.
 Images were reformatted into the coronal and sagittal planes.

 FINDINGS:

 LUNG BASES:  There is consolidation in the right lower lobe and small
 bilateral pleural effusions.

 ABDOMEN:  A percutaneous transhepatic biliary stent is in place with its
 pigtail formed in the region of the hepatic hilum.  The gallbladder is
 decompressed with high-density material in it.  This is consistent with
 vicarious excretion of CT contrast dye.  The spleen, bilateral kidneys, and
 adrenals appear normal.

 There is enlargement of the pancreas with a prominent and irregular pancreatic
 duct measuring up to 5 mm.  There is a moderate amount of surrounding
 inflammatory stranding anterior to the body and tail of the pancreas, with
                                                             (Over)

 fluid tracking along the pararenal fascia and lateral conal fascia consistent
 with acute on chronic pancreatitis.  No calcifications are seen.

 Within the region of the pancreatic head, a large thick-walled cyst measuring
 8.4 x 5.3 x 4.0 cm, is not significantly changed in size compared with prior.
 This splays the SMA from the aorta and exerts mass effect on the duodenum.
 The posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal branch of the SMA appears to pass
 just adjacent to this, and feeds a small (8mm x 4mm) residual pseudoaneurysm.
 The cyst has a moderately thick enhancing rind and displays a hypodense cystic
 central cavity with high-density around its inner rim indicating complete
 thrombosis of the lumen. On the previous comparison CT, this was noted to fill
 with contrast that followed blood pool in density.

 The SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 85**], and bilateral renal arteries are patent.  The right common iliac
 artery is occluded, though this is incompletely imaged, unchanged compared
 with prior study.  There is an accessory left hepatic artery.

 Visualized loops of small and large bowel are normal in caliber and
 enhancement.  There is no intraperitoneal free fluid or free air.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Acute pancreatitis, with large pseudoaneurysm that is now nearly
 completely thrombosed. A small residual pseudoaneurysm remains. Recommend
 ultrasound follow up in the AM.

 2.  Right lower lobe consolidation with bilateral pleural effusion.

 3.  Interval placement of percutaneous transhepatic biliary drain, with
 interval decompression of intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.

 FINDINGS:  Although a left anterior third rib fracture can be visualized, for
 the most part, known left-sided fractures are not well assessed.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Streaky opacities in the lower lungs
 suggest atelectasis in association with low lung volumes.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A mild-to-moderate superior
 endplate compression fracture along an upper thoracic vertebral body appears
 unchanged.  An L1 vertebral body compression fracture is not well assessed,
 but also appears unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with increasing bibasilar atelectasis, but no
 evidence for pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Rib fractures are not well
 assessed.

 COMPARISON:  [**2118-8-17**] chest radiograph.

 FINDINGS:

 The patient is status post median sternotomy CABG.  Right-sided dual chamber
 pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle, unchanged.  There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly which is stable.
 The aorta is mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted with fluid identified within the fissures. Smoothly
 lobulated opacity overlying the right apex is compatible with a loculated
 pleural effusion which has slightly increased when compared to the prior
 study.  Ill-defined streaky opacity within the right lung base appears
 slightly worsened in the interval, which could reflect asymmetric pulmonary
 edema though infection in the right lung base is not completely excluded.  The
 left lung is grossly clear.  There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures with compression deformities in the mid thoracic spine again
 demonstrated.  Clips in the left axilla are again noted.

 IMPRESSION:

 Small bilateral pleural effusions with slight interval increase in loculated
 pleural fluid about the right lung apex.  Patchy opacity within the right lung
 base may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema though infection cannot be
 excluded.

 At the request of house officer Olurinde Mobolaji, images were reviewed with
 attention to the right hip and femur.

 There is moderate to moderately severe diffuse narrowing of the right hip.
 This finding is assymetric -- the left hip joint space is grossly preserved.
 Small right > left marginal spurs are seen about the hip joint. No subchondral
 cyst formation, subchondral sclerosis, or bone erosion is seen in the right or
 left hip joints. There is a probable small right hip joint effusion.  No
 evidence of fracture or osteonecrosis is detected about the right or left hip.
 The right femur is imaged to ~16.7 cm below the level of the hip joint.

 IMPRESSION:

 Osteorarthritis of the right hip, assymetrically worse on the right side, and
 progressed compared with [**2187-12-13**] and [**2188-1-13**] CT scans, with small right hip
 joint effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, this would be concerning
 for septic arthritis. Note is made that the patient is s/p right hip
 aspiration, with negative micro lab results at this time.

 These findings were discussed with Subintern Mobolaji on the afternoon of

 INDICATION:  30-year-old woman with history of IV drug abuse, endocarditis and
 iliopsoas abscess, to assess for other sites of abdominopelvic abscess.

 COMPARISON:  CT pelvis with contrast of [**2188-8-14**] and CT torso with contrast of
 [**2188-8-11**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained
 after the administration of 130 cc of Omnipaque intravenous contrast.
 Sagittal and coronal reformations were performed and reviewed.

 DLP:  441.29 mGy-cm.

 FINDINGS:  Small simple bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since the
 prior study.  Bilateral mild compressive atelectasis of the imaged lung bases
 are noted.  Mitral and tricuspid valvular prosthesis are noted.

 The liver enhances homogeneously, without focal lesions.  There is no intra-
 or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.  The gallbladder is decompressed with
 mild wall edema, which likely relates to third spacing.  Few peripheral
 hypodense areas in the spleen with the largest seen in the inferior pole, are
 consistent with old infarcts.  The pancreas and adrenal glands are normal.
 Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically, without
 hydronephrosis.  There is a small amount of perihepatic and pelvic ascites.
 No rim-enhancing intra-abdominal abscess is seen.  There is no intra-abdominal
 free air. The abdominal aorta is normal in course and caliber.  Small
 scattered retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for significant
 adenopathy.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder, uterus, and
 adnexa are unremarkable.  The rectum and sigmoid colon are normal.  There is a
 small amount of pelvic ascites.

 levels.  Question progression.

 COMPARISON:  [**2143-5-18**] and [**2143-6-2**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with IV and oral
 contrast.  Three-minute delays of the abdomen were also obtained.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE CHEST:  A 3-mm pleural-based nodule in the right upper lobe (2:25)
 is stable.  There is a small right and trace left pleural effusion, new since
 the [**2143-5-18**] study.  Also noted are bilateral dependent atelectatic
 changes.  No focal opacities concerning for an infectious process are seen.
 No central pulmonary embolism is noted.  The aorta and its great branches are
 unremarkable.  The thyroid gland is normal.  No mediastinal or hilar
 lymphadenopathy by CT criteria is noted.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  There is new generalized ascites in the perisplenic and
 perihepatic regions.  The number of hypodense lesions in the liver is
 significantly increased, consistent with progression of disease.  The largest
 lesion in segment II of the liver measures 2.0 x 1.5 cm, previously this
 particular lesion was not readily apparent.  Numerous other lesions are noted
 throughout the liver, many increased in size.  The main portal vein is patent.
 A common bile duct stent is noted which causes pneumobilia.  Gallbladder is
 surgically absent.  Slight nodularity of the left adrenal gland is unchanged.
 The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast without any evidence of
 hydronephrosis.  The stomach, small and large bowel are unremarkable.  Mild
 amount of atherosclerotic disease is again seen in abdominal aorta.  Splenic
 and portal vein are patent.  Ill-defined pancreatic head mass is difficult to
 delineate on today's study; however, the pancreatic duct is dilated
 throughout, increased since the prior study.

 Calcified lymph nodes adjacent to the porta hepatis are unchanged. Stranding
 in the regions around the ascending colon suggest peritoneal involvement of
 disease.

 CT OF THE PELVIS:  There is significant amount of pelvic free fluid, new from
 the prior study.  The prostate is normal in size.  Rectosigmoid colon is
 unremarkable.  Bladder is normal.  No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  56-year-old Patient in need for temporary hemodialysis line.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5129**] [**Name (STitle) 5130**] (fellow) and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13**]
 (attending).

 ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia was provided at the venotomy site.

 PROCEDURE DETAILS:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient
 after explaining the risks, benefits and possible complications of the
 procedure.  The patient was transported to the angiography suite and placed
 supine on the imaging table.  The right neck was prepped and draped in the
 usual fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed as per the [**Hospital1 14**]
 protocol.

 After anesthetizing the skin and subcutaneous tissues, a micropuncture needle
 was inserted into the right internal jugular vein under ultrasound guidance.
 Hard copy ultrasound images were saved for reference.  A 0.018 nitinol wire
 was advanced into the superior vena cava.  After local anesthesia was applied,
 [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 724**] was made along the needle.  The micropuncture needle was then exchanged
 against a micropuncture sheath.  The inner cannula and nitinol wire were
 removed.  A 0.035 J -wire was advanced into the right atrium.  Appropriate
 measurements were made, and an 18 cm tri-luminal temporary hemodialysis line
 was selected.

 Dilations were performed using dilators and the line then placed with its tip
 in the SVC/atrium.  All lumens were withdrawn and flushed easily.  The
 catheter was secured with 2-0 silk sutures, and a sterile dressing was
 applied.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of right IJ temporary hemodialysis line.
 The line is ready for use.

 CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST

 INDICATION:  Suspect abdominal bleeding.

 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen with and without contrast of [**2143-7-8**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial CT images were obtained before and following the
 administration of 150 cc of Omnipaque 350 IV contrast.  Post-contrast images
 were obtained in the arterial and portal venous phase.  Sagittal and coronal
 reconstructions were obtained.  No adverse contrast reactions were noted.

 FINDINGS:

 LOWER CHEST: Small bilateral pleural effusions and subsegmental atelectasis,
 worse on the right. Heart size is normal without pericardial effusion.

 ABDOMEN: The previously identified peripancreatic fluid now demonstrates
 discrete peripheral enhancement at several locations.  There is a 7.4 x 6.0 cm
 fluid collection interposed between the splenic vein and greater curvature of
 the stomach and demonstrates minimal heterogeneity with hyperattenuation which
 persists on the arterial and delayed phases.  This fluid collection was
 previously patchy and ill-defined phlegmonous changes.  The fluid collection
 along the anterior aspect of the pancreatic head is again seen, however,
 appears more discrete on the current exam measuring 3.5 x 4.2 cm with stable
 amount of intrinsic air.  There is new air along the posterior aspect of the
 uncinate process within a less well-defined fluid collection measuring
 approximately 3.8 x 3.6 cm.  The pancreas itself demonstrates normal
 enhancement on the delayed phase without evidence of necrosis. The splenic
 vein remains patent and is normal in caliber.  Previously described narrowing
 of the SMV and portal vein confluence is not appreciated on the current exam.
 The delayed images demonstrate a normally opacified portal vein and SMV.
 Mesenteric venous structures are grossly patent. No mesenteric arterial
 aneurysm is identified.  Specifically, the splenic artery and gastroduodenal
 artery are normal caliber.

 The stomach is decompressed.  Gastrojejunostomy tube has been placed in the
 interim, terminating in the proximal jejunum.  The non-opacified bowel loops
 are normal in caliber without diverticulosis or diverticulitis.  There is a
 stable coarse calcification within the liver.  The remainder of the liver
 enhances homogeneously without focal lesions.  Interval placement of a
 percutaneous cholecystostomy drain with pigtail catheter terminating within a

 (Cont)
 decompressed gallbladder.  No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal
 dilatation.  Previously seen fluid tracking along the inferior aspect of the
 liver now demonstrates increased definition and peripheral enhancement.
 Stable stranding in the right paracolic gutter.

 The spleen demonstrates homogeneous enhancement without focal lesions.  The
 adrenal glands are normal without nodularity.  There is a stable small
 parapelvic cyst within the right kidney.  Kidneys, otherwise, enhance
 symmetrically without hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  No discrete mesenteric
 lymphadenopathy is identified.

 Chronic occlusion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta with changes of a left
 axillary bifemoral graft.  Incidental note is made of a replaced right hepatic
 artery.  The celiac trunk, SMA renal arteries are patent.

 PELVIS:  Urinary bladder is underdistended.  Seminal vesicles are symmetric.
 Prostate gland is unremarkable.  No pelvic free fluid or collection.  No
 lymphadenopathy.

 SKELETAL STRUCTURES AND SOFT TISSUES:  There is subcutaneous stranding
 involving the abdominal wall bilaterally, more pronounced on the right at the
 level of the flank region. No soft tissue hematoma is identified.  Multilevel
 degenerative disc disease with bulky disc osteophytes.  No acute fracture or
 destructive osseous process.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Majority of the previously identified peripancreatic fluid has now
 developed a discretely enhancing wall, consistent with pseudocyst formation.
 New intrinsic air within a less well defined fluid collection posterior to
 uncinate process and stable intrinsic air within fluid collection anterior to
 the pancreatic neck are most likely compatible with infected pseudocyst
 components. Given the homogenous enhancement of the pancreas on delayed
 images, necrotizing pancreatitis is considered less likely, although not
 entirely excluded.
 2. Perihepatic fluid now demonstrates an enhancing wall, suggestive of
 perihepatic extent of pseudocyst formation.
 3. Patent splenic vein. Mesenteric venous structures and portal vein are
 patent. No arterial pseudoaneurysm formation.
 4. Interval placement of gastrojejunostomy tube. New percutaneous
 cholecystostomy tube has pigtail catheter appropriately coiled in the
 decompressed gallbladder.
 5. No abdominal hemorrhage.
 6. Abdominal wall soft tissue stranding and edema, more pronounced on right,
 without hematoma.

 HISTORY:  62-year-old man with history of peripheral vascular disease,
 cirrhosis and family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Assess for
 abdominal aorta.

 FINDINGS:  Atherosclerotic plaque noted in the abdominal aorta.  No evidence
 for abdominal aortic aneurysm.  The largest aortic diameter in the proximal
 abdominal aorta is approximately 2.2 cm, in the mid portion of the aorta 2 cm
 and above the bifurcation, it is 1.4 cm.  Similarly, the iliac arteries are of
 normal caliber.  Both kidneys appear normal, right measuring 9.7 cm and the
 left kidney 9.8 cm.

 CONCLUSION:  No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.

 INDICATION:  Necrotizing pancreatitis with recent drainage of fluid
 collection, now with fever.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector helical CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was
 obtained after the administration of 130 cc IV Omnipaque contrast and oral
 contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were prepared.

 DOSE:  DLP 627 mGy-cm.

 COMPARISON:  CT scan dated [**2158-10-21**].

 FINDINGS:  There are moderate-to-large partially imaged bilateral pleural
 effusions and associated atelectasis.

 Throughout the abdomen and pelvis there are several multiloculated
 collections.  A rim-enhancing subcapsular collection measuring up to 3.1 cm in
 thickness around the lateral edge appears similar to the prior examination.

 The largest collection contains a pigtail catheter inferior to the tip of the
 liver and the collection appears to be continuous crossing the midline with
 loculations extending to the left hemiabdomen.  As compared to the prior
 examination, there has been significant decrease in this collection.
 Previously measured loculations measuring 18.2 x 8.6 cm, now measure 9.6 x 4.0
 cm on similar image.  There are, however, several small collections which are
 isolated and not drained.

 There is a 10.9 x 2.1 x 8.1-cm collection subjacent to the right anterior
 abdominal wall as well as a large 10.2 x 8.4 pelvic collection (2:78), which

 does not appear significantly changed from the prior exam.  As compared to the
 prior exam, these collections appear to demonstrate slight interval wall
 thickening and rim enhancement.

 Two esophageal catheters are in place, one extending to the jejunum.  Much of
 the pancreatic body and proximal tail appear necrotic with fluid replacement.
 There is focal calcification in the pancreatic head.

 Loops of small and large bowel appear normal in size and caliber.  The liver
 border is distorted by subcapsular fluid collections; however, the liver
 parenchyma itself appears grossly normal.  The spleen, gallbladder, adrenal

 DLP:  843.90 mGy-cm.

 FINDINGS:

 Again seen is persistent basilar airspace consolidation in the lung bases with
 a component of atelectasis and small left-sided pleural effusion.  Small

                                 FINAL REPORT
 (Cont)
 The stomach, duodenum, small bowel and large bowel are all markedly dilated
 with multiple air-fluid levels, but with no focal area of obstruction.  There
 is a 4.7 x 3.9 cm rim-enhancing loculated fluid collection in the adjacent
 hepatic flexure, which corresponds to the site of the previous fluid
 collection that was previously drained.

 The intra-abdominal vasculature is unremarkable with normal caliber abdominal
 aorta and patent celiac axis, SMA, bilateral renal arteries and [**Female First Name (un) 635**].  An IVC
 filter is visualized in the inferior vena cava.  There is no intra-abdominal
 free air, ascites or hernias noted.  There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric
 lymphadenopathy.  There is paraspinal muscle atrophy consistent with the
 patient's paraplegia.

 CT PELVIS:  A suprapubic catheter is seen leading into the bladder.  Prostate
 is unremarkable in appearance.  The rectum is unremarkable in appearance.
 There is no pelvic free fluid or air.  There is no inguinal or pelvic wall
 lymphadenopathy.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are degenerative changes in bilateral SI joints.
 There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine.  There
 are no focal blastic or lytic lesions in the visualized osseous structures
 concerning for malignancy.

 IMPRESSION

 1.  4.7 x 3.9 cm rim-enhancing loculated fluid collection abutting the hepatic
 flexure, likely reaccumulation of previously drained fluid. Cannot rule out
 infectious process; however, there are no features (thickened wall, adjacent
 fat stranding, internal air or complexity) to distinctly suggest infection.
 2.  Bibasilar consolidations with small left pleural effusion and thickened
 pleura, possibly representing chronic infectious process.
 3.  Chronically distended small and large bowel to the rectum with multiple
 air-fluid levels consistent with pseudo-obstructive process.
 4.  Hyperdensities within the gallbladder likely representing gallstones or
 sludge.
 5.  2.5 cm left renal interpolar cyst with multiple bilateral millimetric
 renal hypodensities.

  Events:  Pt continues on 20% wean of sedative gtts.  However in setting of significant contraction alkalosis, propofol gtt started last pm to help decrease RR drive and correct high pH.  All diuresis stopped and plan is to let pt re-equilibrate his serum bicarb.  When it normalizes, further attempts will be made to wake pt up and to wean from vent.  Persistant fevers continue despite q 4 hour tylenol.

  Neuro:  Fentanyl weaned from 25 mcg/hr to off and versed weaned from 1.5 mg/hr to 1.0 mg/hr.  Propofol continues at 30 mcg/kg/min.  Pt sedated with no spontaneous movement.  At times, pt mildly agitated with some paradoxical breathing, but this resolves without intervention.  No s/sx of withdrawal.

 CV:  Pt in NSR-ST.  BP stable with MAP's consistantly > 60.  Systolic BP at times in 80's, but this is associated with acceptable MAP and good UOP.  Hct stable.  Lytes sent at 1600--K+3.6--40 meq KCL repleted per ss order.  Calcium gtt off and level appears to be stable--plan to follow calcium closely and replete if needed (pt will need prn order).

  Pulm:  Pt continues on AC 10/550/50%/10.  RR continues to be in low 20's, but ABG at 1600 shows improved pH.  Pt suctioned X 2 for small amts [**Year (4 digits) **] white sputum.  Lungs course.  Trach site benign without bleeding or drainage.

  GI:  Pt on goal TF of peptamin at 75 cc/hr via post-pyleoric tube.  NGT to LIWS--draining large amts (> 800 cc/shift) of green bile.  Diarrhea continues--golden liquid stool.  FICC bag in place and functioning well.  Team decreasing bowel regimen and will send samples if diarrhea continues.

  GU:  Foley to gravity.  UOP acceptable off lasix.  NFB still very negative today in setting of large NGT and stool output.

  Skin:  Duoderm intact to coccyx.  Scrotum with many broken blisters--barrier cream and absorbant pads covering areas.

  Family:  Pts wife and dtr-in-law in to visit this afternoon.  Very encouraged by pts progress (e. g. with trach) and are hopeful of good recovery.  All questioned answered and family updated on POC.
  1.  Continue propofol gtt to keep RR depressed in setting of metabollic alkalosis.  Wean versed gtt to off tommorrow.  Consider prn morphine/ativan if pt shows s/sx of withdrawal, but gtts have been weaned very slowly over last week, so hopefully withdrawal is unlikely.
  2.  Follow ionized calcium closely after CaCl gtt d/c'd.

Neuro:  Pt is awake and alert, OOB to a chair with a 2 person assist, she was glad to be up.  She has a weak voice but it has gotten stronger through the day.  She talked to me this afternoon about how hard it was for her to be intubated, she said that she couldn't talk, the tube was hard and it hurt, she wanted to see the ETT and to keep it.  She did smile some today and was certainly more animated today than ysterday.  She said that she would want to be resusitated if her heart stopped but would not want to be reintubated.

CV:  BP stable 120s-130s/50s, HR mainly in the 80s but she did go into a sinus tach twice, she converted to SR with  mg of IV dilt and the next time she converted with coughing.  She is now on PO lopreoor 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].

Resp:  She conts to have a wet cough and is bringing up thick yellow to white sputum.  She is now on both albuterol and atrovent inhalers.  Her 02 SATs have been in the upper 90s on 3 L NC, no c/o SOB. She did take her TB meds today but they were stopped this afternoon since her LFTs cont to rise.  As above, she does not want to be reintubated but does want to be resusitated should her heart stop.

GI:  She conts to have loose to liquid stool.  She wanted something to drink, she was given water and she coughed every time that she drank it, when she ate jello she did much better and did not cough.  When she put her head down to swallow she didn't cough when she took sips of water.  Nor did she cough with nector consistant cranberry juice.  She will have a formal bedside swallowing study.  She was able to take her pills.  Her LFTs conts to rise, her TB meds were d/ced and she will have an US.  Her SQ heparin was d/ced because her PTT is 57 and she has an INR of 1.7.

GU:  U/O ~ 50cc/hr, to have another U/A sent.

Soc:  Her son from [**Name (NI) **] called and she had a visitor this afternoon.

Significant Events: Family meeting, do not resuscitate established-pt still intubated. Pt's insulin increasing according to [**Last Name (un) 167**] scale, neo weaning down-currently off. Vent changes made according to ABGs. CT to water seal per trauma team. Family informed about pt's non small cell lung CA diagnosis (lung biopsy results)

Neuro: Ativan and Dilaudid (.5mg each) alternated throughout shift to maintain comfort/adequate sedation and to maintain cardiac goals. When less sedated, pt moves upper extremities spontaneously, opens eyes spontaneously, does not follow all commands.  Pt unable to communicate d/t ET tube. Pt localizes to pain. Pt is immobilized (both arms-soft limb) for safety-pt's family aware and understanding.

Pain: Pt assessed by vital signs and nonverbal cues as having no pain throughout shift. Pt given dilaudid PRN for sedation/pain coverage.

CV: Extensive cardiac history, cardiac team in to speak with family, assessed pt and pt's compatibility for surgery. HR 70's (goal <80), no ectopy, NSR. ABP systolic 120-140's, MAP >70, goal MAP >65.  Easily palpable pedal pulses, warm extremities. Heparin sc, PBoots on.

Resp: Lung sounds coarse on left side, diminished in bases and on right side. Vent settings currently PEEP 5, PS 8, 40% FiO2. Suctioned for thick, yellow secretions. Mouth care per VAP protocol.

GI: Abdomen soft, not distended, nontender. +BS, +Bowel meds, -BM. Tube feeds (Probalance) at goal, tolerating well. Fluid boluses continue.'

GU: Adequate clear, yellow urine through foley qhour.

Endo: Insulin sliding scale off at 07:00, increased throughout day according to [**Last Name (un) 167**] scale-BS checked qhour.

Skin: Intact. Pt repositioned frequently, back intact.

Social: Family meeting with pt's wife, daughter-in-law, and son about treatment plan regarding tumors/code status/pt's wishes. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2371**], ICU HO Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5291**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2186**] (SW), this RN, and [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 427**] interpreter present (pt's family declined interpreter halfway through meeting d/t adequate translating between family members-pt's wife felt like translator present was overwhelming/distracting). Discussion included: plan of care/treatment plan for brain tumor. Family understood/agreed to plan of not treating brain tumor at this time d/t PMH/high risk. Wish to concentrate on current trauma and see how pt's respiratory status progresses. Family expressed that pt has discussed advanced directives, would not want to \"live like a vegetable\" or rely on machinery to live. Pt's family expessed that they would like pt to be comfortable, would like pt to remain intubated at this time, but decline resuscitation should it be needed- no CPR. Also briefly discussed possibility of trach/future re-intubation and potential course of disease process. Pt's family would like to think about discussion and make decisions about re-intubation/other decisions before coming to conclusion.

Infant is a FT, 3690 FT male newborn who was admitted to the NICU for concerns of possible stridor.

Infant was born to a 21 y.o. G1 P0 to 1 mother.  Serologies: O+, ab neg, hep neg, RPR NR, RI, GBS neg, GC/Chl/PPD neg.  Prognancy was uncomplicated. Ther is a report of Gonnorhea during pregnancy which was treated and mother now tests negative.

Mother presented in spontaneous labor. Proceeded to vaginal delivery. +meconium. Not intubated as infant cried soon after delivery. However, infant after cries stopped crying with no spontaneous respirations requiring PPV for several breaths with good response.  Apgars 4,8.  In DR, infant thought to have stridor with vigorous crying.  Transported to NICU for evaluation.

Other sepsis risks: No maternal fever, ROM > 48 hours, +intrapartum abx for almost 24 hours.

Currently on exam:

Infant appears very comfortable without respiratory distress, no GFR, no stridor. When infant cries vigorously slight hoarseness to cry, and high-pitched inspiration but not stridor.  AFSF. +Molding. Intact palate with good vigorous suck. Neck without masses. Lungs CTA, =, no stridor audible with stethoscope. CV RRR, no murmur, 2+ FP. Abd soft, +BS. GU nl phallus, testes down bilat. Patent anus, no sacral anomalies, stable hips, ext pink and well perfused. Symmetrical Moro.

Impression:
1.  AGA, FT male newborn.
2.  r/o stridor - current exam does not support stridor. Does have a very slight hoarse cry and high pitched inspiration with vigorous crying.  Infant is without any distress from this.
3.  No sepsis risk factors (besides ROM > 24 hours).

Plan:
1.  Infant has been observed and he demonstrates no distress. Sats 100% in RA.  If tolerates feeding without instability, will transfer to NBN for further care.
2.  Infant without significant sepsis risk factors.  will not send lab work at this time. If clinical course changes will proceed with sepsis evaluation at that time.

   Assessment and Plan
   64yo woman with new malignancy, probable large cell carcinoma, hypoxia,
   and Afib with RVR.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   In setting of hypoxia and mediastinal malignancy.  Thought to be
   dehydrated yesterday, but patient
s response to fluid challenge was to
   increase her urine output, suggesting that she is in fact euvolemic.
   TSH normal.  No evidence for ischemia.
   -          currently on diltiazem gtt; will wean if possible, but will
   not try to be aggressive with decreasing dilt given tenuous control of
   HR
   -          s/p amiodarone IV load, dc
d per cardiology recs
   -          continue to titrate up PO metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -          anticoagulate with heparin gtt
   -          appreciate cardiology recs
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Postobstructive
   -          continue vanc and zosyn for total of 2 week course (day 1 =
   [**2-13**]; last day to treat = [**2-26**])
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Prelim diagnosis is large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
   Probably liver metastases.
   -          per oncology, plan to initiate chemotherapy today in setting
   of rapid progression of tumor
   -          plan to start taxol and carboplatin today
   -          will watch for potential toxicities:  taxol
anaphylaxis
   (would give more IV steroid), bradycardia; carboplatin
acute renal
   failure
   -          will start G-CSF tomorrow
   -          appreciate rad/onc input (per oncology, plan will be to
   continue XRT)
 HYPERCALCEMIA (HIGH CALCIUM)
   -          awaiting PTHrp
   -          Calcium improved with IV fluids
   -          Will check ionized calcium given that albumin is low, so
   total calcium is likely to be underestimation of extent of
   hypercalcemia
   -          No indication for pamidronate at this time
 HYPOXEMIA
   -          patient has obstruction of left main bronchus with collapsed
   left lung
   -          not a candidate for stenting per IP
   -          monitor daily CXR
 NAUSEA / VOMITING
   -          likely to be from compression of esophagus, though
   constipation may contribute
   -          likely to worsen with initiation of chemotherapy
   -          zofran and compazine
   -          KUB without evidence of obstruction
   -          Bowel regimen
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   -          diltiazem, beta blocker
   # C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   -          continue PO vanc for 14 day course after IV vanc/zosyn
   stopped
   -          not currently having diarrhea
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Regular diet with ensure; poor PO intake

   able to tolerate trach for 3 hours at a time and tolerating soft diet
   2.  Metastatic Cervical Cancer
   -oncology team will give final recommendation regarding utility of
   chemo, appreciate input
   -possible plan for chemotherapy at NY Presbyterian
   3.  Pneumothorax:  CT showed small PTX possibly communicating with L
   tumor mass, which has air in it. Unlikely to resolve on its own.
   -appreciate IP input
   -pig tail in left chest, currently clamped
   -continues to have small PTX on CXR
   4.  Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia:  Thrombocytopenia resolved, plts
   in 400's
   -holding all heparin products, no systemic anticoagulation given risk
   of bleeding due to tumor proximity to pulmonary artery
   -no evidence of thrombosis on exam
   5.  Tachycardia:  Improved overnight in 110's, initially due to PTX
   -continue to monitor, baseline in 110's
   -if concern for increase, would consider enlargement of PTX or anemia
   as discussed below
   6.  Pulmonary Embolism
   -not a candidate for therapeutic anticoagulation give tumor proximity
   to pulmonary artery
   7.  Anemia: at 21.7 today, stable
   -no acute need for transfusion at this time
   -if tachycardia increases, wold consider anemia or bleed in the
   differential given proximity of tumor to PA as above.
   8.  Leukopenia:  Resolving at 3.5 today
   -continue to monitor
   9.  LE Edema: Persistent, likely [**1-10**] IVC filter or tumor compression or
   volume overload
   -bp's in 90-100
   -patient unable to tolerate leg elevation as causes SOB
   -will give Lasix 10mg po as trial for diuresis with goal to improve leg

   surgery following.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis, Prosthetic Aortic Valve
   - Does not appear that root is infected as this could be all
   postoperative change, though cannot be certain.
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for
   synergy.  Check trough this afternoon.
   - Gent dosing changed yesterday per ID
   - bone scan yesterday only included foot was non-specific.  Consider
   white blood cell scan
 will discuss utility with ID.
   - For now pursuing with medical therapy as no hemodynamic compromise
   - f/u daily ID recs
   # Infected Pacer Leads
   - Given large vegetations might be difficult to remove immediately.
   - Appreciate EP following, adjustment made to sensing to determine if
   temp wires would be needed if pacer wires removed.
   - Plan to manage medically currently.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 Resolved, on nasal cannula.  Weaning off of
   oxygen.
   - Appreciate pulm recs
   - Consider CPAP given possibility of OSA if needed
   .
   # Anemia
 Likely BLOOD LOSS and INFLAMMATION as dual contributors.
   Hct 24.7 today.
   - Gastroocult + NGT secretions, now on [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - Check hct in AM.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 -

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 y/o M w/ emphysema, metastatic NSCLC, CAD, who p/w
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #Respiratory: Pt with tight airways overnight and diffuse wheezing in
   the AM responsive to nebs.  Likely etiology is COPD flare with
   underlying severe lung disease [**12-26**] metastatic NSCLC.  Pt did not need
   BiPAP overnight but appeared to be working hard this AM.  Given
   bilateral ground glass opacities on CT scan would consider PCP
   pneumonia in the setting of recent steroid use from chemotherapy.
   - Prednisone 60mg PO, nebulizers, Azithromycin for COPD
   - f/u sputum cxs
   - will c/s covering for possible PCP given elevated LDH and recent
   steroid use (only add if CT chest suggest PCP).
   - BNP only mildly elevated -> does not appear fluid overloaded on exam
   - f/u viral screen
   - Wean oxygen on venti mask.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Concerning for infection, possible complication of
   therapy with Alimta with superimposed infection.  Leukemia unlikely
   given normal smear.
   - Pan-culture including C. Diff.
   - Trend WBCs
   - c/s Heme/Onc consult re: possible role of Alimta in causing severe
   leukocytosis
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - hold beta-blockers given COPD flare
   - avoid hydralazine if possible given h/o TAA
   - start captopril
   .
   #CAD: Continue statin, give low dose aspirin 81mg daily.  Hold
   beta-blocker for now [**12-26**] COPD flare.
   .
   #Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Pt without abdominal pain or hypotension.
