#### About the workshop

Winter workshop in data science is a five-day (intensive) data science program, where a team of professionals from the industry learn fundamentals of data science. The workshop is designed to demystify data science and to empower professionals perform data analytics using the R programming language. We will study and practice a wide range of topics, including R fundamentals, visualization, data manipulation and modeling. 

#### Expectations

The workshop **does not** have any pre-requisites, although a little programming experince will be a huge plus. There will be both hands-on sessions and lectures, and the trainees are encouraged (but not required) to bring their own data sets. Towards the end of this workshop the trainee will exhibit in-depth understanding of data science and analysis methods as well as proficiency in R. He/She will produce a portfolio that demonstrates mastery of analysis and visualization methods. 

#### Agenda

Each day the session will begin at 9 am and end at 4.30 pm with on-your-own lunch break between 12 noon and 1.30 pm. Lectures will be held between 9-10 am and 1.30-2.30 pm followed by hands-on sessions. The lecture agenda are as follows:

Day 1: Git and R fundamentals
